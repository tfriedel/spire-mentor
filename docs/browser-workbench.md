# Browser-only workbench (M1 – M5)

The workbench SPA running with **no backend**: the Rust engine, compiled to
WebAssembly, answers every `/api/*` call from a Web Worker; runs persist in
IndexedDB; the page is an installable PWA that works offline. This is the
Android/offline route decided on 2026-09-02 — the Python FastAPI workbench
(`sts2-pycli/python/workbench`) and its Cloud Run deploy stay as-is and act as
the **oracle** the port is measured against until parity is complete.

Milestone 1 ships the **play loop, rewind (seek / branch tree) and named
saves** with full localization and art. Milestone 2 adds the **advisors**
(combat hint, search tree, choice ranker, "play best", regret coach / review,
the card and decision EV advisors with streamed progress) — see "Advisors"
below. Milestone 3 adds **run mode**: the PPO champion net runs in the
browser (tract-onnx compiled to wasm), the native run agent plays "play to
end" and autobattle, every non-combat decision is scored for the WPA review
and verify, and run-mode saves restore — see "Run mode" below. Milestone 4 adds the
**replay viewer** (a finished run leaves its JSONL log in IndexedDB; the
timeline, map, step view, recommend / search tree, regret and run reviews,
the MCTS Runs page and "play from here" all work over it) and the **deck
analysis** routes — see "Replay viewer" below. Milestone 5 adds **bug
reports** on the Pages host and **state import** — paste a run position
copied out of the live game and rebuild it in the browser (see those two
sections below), and the SimLab sandbox plus its distribution sweeps (GH
#707). The static build's `/api/capabilities` flags are `advisors, run_mode,
saves, replay, state_import, simlab, simlab_sweeps: true` and `bug_reports:
false` — the engine has no upload target for reports, so the SPA turns the
report button on itself when the Pages host answers the probe.

```

| Layer | Where | What it is |
|---|---|---|
| `sts2-workbench` | `sts2-rs/crates/sts2-workbench` | Rust port of the Python workbench (`backends/rust_game.py`, `branching.py`, `server.py::_enrich`, `localization.py`, `assets.py`, `render.py`, `options.py`, `statediff.py`, `combatlog.py`, `saves.py`, …). JSON in / JSON out, no I/O, no threads, no clock. `Workbench::call` is shaped exactly like the FastAPI routes (same paths, bodies, 400/404/409 status codes). |
| `sts2-wire::emit` | `sts2-rs/crates/sts2-wire/src/emit/` | `serde_json::Value` twins of the PyO3 dict builders (combat state, run actions, full map, shop inventory, event options, …, and since M2 `emit::mcts`: the `mcts_recommend` / `mcts_search_tree` result dicts plus the one parser of their `config`). `sts2-py` now returns `pythonize(&value)` over them, so the Python workbench and the port read **the same** dicts by construction. |
| `sts2-vocab` | `sts2-rs/crates/sts2-vocab` | The PPO vocabulary, split out of `sts2-runai` so `sts2-wire` no longer pulls tract-onnx / rayon into the wasm graph. |
| `sts2-workbench-wasm` | `sts2-rs/crates/sts2-workbench-wasm` | The `wasm-bindgen` shell: `new(config_json)`, `call`, `build_save`, `restore_save`, `save_header`, `export_persist`, `import_persist(payload, progress_cb)`. |
| Embedded data | `sts2-rs/crates/sts2-workbench/data/` | `include_str!` bundle (localization_eng copies, trimmed wiki card/monster/owned tables, the art manifest, creature scales; ~1 MB raw). Regenerate with `just workbench-data`; `just check-workbench-data` gates drift. |
| Worker + transport | `web/src/worker/`, `web/src/transport/` | `apiFetch` replaces the 58 `fetch("/api/…")` calls in `api.ts`. In static mode it posts `{id, method, route, body}` to the worker and wraps the reply in a real `Response`, so nothing above `api.ts` (or in vitest) can tell the two modes apart. The worker owns the save routes and writes `export_persist()` to IndexedDB after every mutating call. |
| PWA | `web/public/sw.js`, `manifest.webmanifest`, `src/pwa.ts` | Hand-written service worker (shell + wasm cache-first, art cache with quota-aware eviction). Registered only in static mode. **Do not put `"orientation"` back in the manifest**: Chrome bakes it into the WebAPK's Android activity, and Android throws `IllegalStateException: Only fullscreen opaque activities can request orientation` on a `standalone` activity — the installed app then dies at launch (the icon does nothing) while a browser tab, which ignores the field, stays fine. Lock the orientation from JS (`screen.orientation.lock`) if it is ever wanted. |

### Engine prerequisites that landed with M1

- `wasm32-unknown-unknown` in `rust-toolchain.toml`; `[profile.wasm-release]`.
- `sts2-runai` features `ppo` (tract-onnx) and `sweeps` (rayon / `Instant`) —
  both default-on, both off for the wasm graph.
- `getrandom` 0.2 `js` feature on wasm targets (rand 0.8 in sts2-mcts / sts2-runai).
- Content dispatch registries (cards, relics, potions) are installed by the
  workbench's run constructor (`game::ensure_content_installed`), the same
  way the `sts2_rs` module import and the CLI do. Without it a wasm build
  links none of the relic / potion hooks — dead-code elimination drops them
  and every on-obtain effect silently no-ops. The golden replay caught this.

## Build, run, gates

### One-time toolchain

`wasm-build` shells out to the **`wasm-bindgen` CLI**, which cargo does not
install for you, and its version must equal the `wasm-bindgen` crate version in
`sts2-rs/Cargo.lock` — wasm-bindgen refuses an artifact produced by a different
version. The build (`sts2-pycli/scripts/workbench_static.py`) checks both
before it compiles and prints the install command. The wasm target itself
comes with the toolchain `sts2-rs/rust-toolchain.toml` pins.

```
cargo install wasm-bindgen-cli --locked \
    --version "$(grep -A1 'name = "wasm-bindgen"' sts2-rs/Cargo.lock | grep version | head -1 | cut -d'"' -f2)"
```

`wasm-opt` (binaryen) is optional — a system install is used if present, else
the `binaryen` npm package `_web-deps` puts in `web/node_modules`; without
either, the build ships the unoptimized wasm with a note (~30% larger).

All from `sts2-pycli/`:

```
just wasm-check            # cargo check of the wasm graph (+ --no-default-features mcts/runai)
just wasm-build            # wasm-release build → wasm-bindgen --target web → web/src/wasm/pkg/
just workbench-static      # wasm-build + VITE_WORKBENCH_MODE=static npm run build → web/dist
just workbench-static-preview   # vite preview on :4173 with ../sts2-wiki art mounted at /assets
just e2e-static            # Playwright against the static build (web/e2e-static/)

just workbench-data / check-workbench-data       # embedded data bundle
just workbench-golden-dump / workbench-golden-check   # oracle fixtures (below)
```

Dev without a build: `cd web && npm run dev:static` (art served from
`../../sts2-wiki/site/public/images` by a Vite plugin). The static build ships
that same tree inside `web/dist/assets` as WebP under the `.png` names
(`scripts/art_to_dist.py`; ~70 MB instead of ~300), so the deployed site is
self-contained (no GCS bucket: its downloads are billed to the project, which
is on the free plan) and a full download fits the host's 360 MB/day quota.
`VITE_ASSETS_BASE=https://…` builds against a hosted art origin instead.

Offline: the service worker precaches the shell and caches art and PPO nets
as they are fetched; the topbar's **⬇ Download for offline** button
(`src/offline.ts`) fills both caches up front from `wb-art-list.json` +
`/ppo/index.json` (~110 MB once per device, resumable), after which any fight
renders with the network off.

Hosted: the owner's deployment (URL not published; `https://your-workbench.example.com` stands in for it below) on Cloudflare Pages (public
unlisted, free plan with no bandwidth cap; `just deploy-static-cf`, and
`just deploy-static-cf-preview [branch]` for a preview origin to test a phone
against). It started on Firebase Hosting, whose free plan caps transfer at
360 MB/day per project — three offline downloads; that site was disabled on
2026-09-03 and there is no fallback host. The build has an art-manifest gate
on the copied tree. Headers, cache rules and the one-time bootstrap:
`sts2-pycli/deploy/DEPLOY.md` § "Browser-only workbench on Cloudflare Pages".
The service worker precaches the whole shell (from `wb-precache.json`,
written by the Vite build) so the app works offline from the first visit; the
art cache survives redeploys.

### Gates

Rust (`sts2-rs/`): the usual six plus gate 7 in `sts2-rs/CLAUDE.md`
(`cargo check --target wasm32-unknown-unknown -p sts2-workbench-wasm`).
`cargo nextest run -p sts2-workbench` runs the ported unit tests, the
`play_smoke` scripted run and the **golden parity replay**.

Python (`sts2-pycli/`): `pytest tests/` — `tests/workbench/golden/` pins the
dump script; `sts2-py` parity now rides on the emit twins.

Web (`sts2-pycli/web/`): `npm run lint && npm test && npm run build`, then
`just e2e-static`.

## Parity against the Python oracle

`sts2-pycli/scripts/dump_workbench_golden.py` drives the **Python** workbench
(`create_app(...)` under FastAPI's TestClient, `assets_base=https://assets.test`,
a fixed `saved_at`) through the scenario matrix in
`sts2-pycli/tests/workbench/golden/scenarios/*.json` — 5 characters × 2 seeds
× {A0, A10} × {overgrowth, underdocks} plus three long `act1=roll` runs to
`game_over`, with `state` / `map` / `timeline` / `seek` / `save` / `load`
probes — and records every request plus the SHA-256 of its normalized
response (full bodies for the first occurrence of each decision kind and every
non-200) under `sts2-rs/crates/sts2-workbench/tests/golden/`. M3 adds three
`runmode_*` scenarios started through `/api/live/start-faithful` at a tiny
combat budget, with `run_mode` / `run_mode_step` / `autobattle_*` /
`ppo_policy` / `wpa_review` / `wpa_verify` probes; two of them are flagged
`"ppo": true`, which lifts the dump's champion stub so the Python side serves
the committed net through its Rust ONNX backend — the same tract inference
over the same bytes the browser runs, so the panel probabilities, the node
values and the WPA review hash-match. Every other scenario runs with the
loader stubbed to answer `no PPO net loaded for <character>` — the browser
port's wording before its host has fetched a champion — so both hosts
answer the same "no net" panel.

`crates/sts2-workbench/tests/golden_parity.rs` replays the same requests
through `Workbench::call` (save routes emulated in memory) and compares
hashes. Normalization on both sides: sorted keys, `log_path` / `path`
dropped, floats rounded like Python's `round(x, 4)` (exact, ties-to-even —
`(x*1e4).round()/1e4` is *not* that), compact JSON. **43 scenarios, 5917
requests, 0 divergences** at M1; **6709 requests** at M2 with the advisor
probes (`hint` / `search_tree` / `choice_ranker` at fixed steps — a 409 off
combat, a seeded 48-sim search in a fight — plus `auto_action`,
`last_move_regret`, `regret_review`); **46 scenarios, 7218 requests** at M3;
**8454 requests** at M4, every scenario ending with a quit and the replay
block (list, load, timeline, map, steps, deck grades, the reviews, the
searches, the MCTS Runs page, play-from-here) plus live deck-analysis and
reward-preview probes. The run-mode routes hash-match because the run agent
is the same Rust code on both hosts; `autobattle/verdict` is structural in
the scenarios without a net, where the brain's pick is each host's own
heuristic; `/api/runs` and `/api/runs/stat` (host paths, mtimes) and the
replay's `recommend` / `search_tree` / `regret-review` (exact-state
re-searches, see "Replay viewer") are structural too.

Three of those routes are compared by status + key shape instead of hash
(`STRUCTURAL_ROUTES` in the test), each for a reason the port will not
undo: the regret coach and review re-score the parent node's **native**
combat snapshot, where the Python session — which no longer holds that
state — re-scores a lossy wire dict and answers 409 for moves it cannot
resolve (a potion's `potion_index` it never read, a card the round-trip
dropped); "play best" off combat asks the Rust `HeuristicPolicy`, where
Python asks its own `run_policy` heuristic (or the PPO brain). The test
allows `python 409 / rust 200` on the coach and never the reverse.

Oracle quirks fixed in Python on the way (both re-dumped):

- `/api/live/state` did not pass `hp_ranges` to `_live_step`, so a
  rehydrated combat lost its `size_jitter`.
- `RustGame._serialize` guarded `bg_seed` with `callable(run_seed)`, but
  `run_seed` is a PyO3 getter (an int), so the room background seed was never
  emitted for live runs.
- (M3) `BranchingLiveSession._node_value` never passed `character=`, so every
  run's node values — the WPA review's whole data — came from the DEFAULT
  character's champion (Ironclad's net valued Silent's decisions). Caught
  by the Silent `ppo: true` scenario: the Rust port's root value differed.
- (M3) `ppo_policy._get_rust_agent` built `PpoRunAgent(model_path=…)`, which
  falls back to the process-wide `STS2_PPO_FEATURES` for the encoder schema
  — empty on the server — so Ironclad's `reward_upgrade` champion was served
  at the default schema (GH #545's exact failure). The binding now takes
  `features=` and the loader passes the manifest's spec.

Rules for the parity window: any Python workbench change that touches a
response re-dumps the goldens (`just workbench-golden-dump`), and any new
normalization ignore needs a comment naming a GitHub issue.

## Advisors (M2)

`crates/sts2-workbench/src/advisors.rs` ports `reasoning.py`,
`choice_ranker.py`, `regret_review.py`, `card_advisor.py` and
`decision_advisor.py` over the live session; `api.rs` mounts them on the
Python routes (`/api/live/hint`, `search_tree`, `choice-ranker`,
`auto-action`, `last-move-regret`, `regret-review`, `card-advisor[/stream]`,
`decision-advisor[/stream]`). Everything is single-threaded — a config's
`threads` is honoured as 1 — and the search-backed routes are deterministic
for a config, which is what makes them golden-testable.

- **Search-backed**: one `sts2_wire::emit::mcts::recommend_value` /
  `search_tree_value` over the engine `CombatState`. The hint's rows, the
  ranker's per-option join (`choice:{opt}` / `choice:skip`) and "play best"
  (the ranker's starred option in an in-combat choice, the tier-1
  `HeuristicPolicy` elsewhere, verbs looked up in the rendered option list)
  are the Python code line for line. `Session` nodes now keep the engine's
  combat state (`Node::combat`, in memory only, rebuilt by replay on
  restore) so the regret coach scores the real parent position.
- **Rollout-backed**: the card / decision advisors fork the `RunManager`
  per option, take it, and play the rest of the act out `rollouts` times
  (cheap depth-10 MCTS at `sims` in combat — `sims: 0` is a random move —
  the heuristic run policy off combat), paired by seed across options.
  Progress goes through a `FnMut(&Value)` sink → `Workbench::call_stream`
  → the wasm `call_stream(…, on_frame)` → `{id, frame}` worker messages →
  a `ReadableStream` body in `apiFetch` with `application/x-ndjson`, so
  `api.ts`'s line readers and the progress bars are untouched. A
  non-applicable stream is an `{"type": "error"}` line on a 200, like the
  Python server (`advice_stream.py`).

Cost on the tablet (Xiaomi Pad Mini, 0.023 ms/sim): the hint at the
default 2000 sims is ~50 ms; the EV advisors at their defaults (12 rollouts
× 128 sims × the rest of the act) run for tens of seconds — the SPA's
budget selectors apply as before.

## Run mode (M3)

`crates/sts2-workbench/src/runmode.rs`, `session_runmode.rs` and `ppo.rs`
port `BranchingLiveSession.start_run_mode` / `run_mode_step` /
`play_to_end`, `autobattle.py` + the autobattle loop and verdict,
`ppo_policy.py` + `ppo_policy_panel`, and `wpa_review.py` + `wpa_verify`;
`api.rs` mounts `/api/live/start-faithful`, `run-mode`, `run-mode-step`,
`faithful-step`, `play-to-end`, `autobattle/{advance,step,verdict}`,
`ppo-policy`, `wpa-review` and `wpa-verify`.

- **The champion net.** `sts2-runai`'s `ppo` feature (tract-onnx) is on in
  the wasm graph (`PpoNet::from_bytes` / `PpoPolicy::from_bytes_with`; the
  only wasm-specific fix was getrandom 0.4's `wasm_js` opt-in, pulled in by
  tract's `rand`). The worker fetches `/ppo/<file>` — the exact filename
  `champions.toml`'s generated table names for the run's character,
  `Workbench::ppo_champion_file` — before any route that starts or restores
  a run and hands the bytes to `Workbench::load_ppo`, once per character. A
  failed fetch (offline on first use) is recorded (`set_ppo_error`) and the
  run goes on exactly as Python does without a checkpoint: the panel says
  `no PPO net loaded for <character>: …`, node values stay `null`, the `ppo`
  brain falls back to the heuristic. The static build copies the five
  champion files into `dist/ppo/` (`vite.config.ts`, read off
  `champions.toml`; the dev/preview server mounts `../data/ppo`); they are
  NOT precached (8.5 MB each), the service worker keeps them cache-first
  (`wb-ppo-v1`, across deploys — a promotion changes the filename) and
  `_headers` serves `/ppo/*` immutable.
- **Size.** With the net reachable (parser + optimizer + ops) tract adds
  ~17 MB raw to the engine (5.5 → 22.9 MB raw, 1.65 → 6.0 MB gzip);
  `wasm-opt -O3` brings that to 19.5 MB raw / 5.4 MB gzip. `just wasm-build` runs a system `wasm-opt`
  if there is one, else the `binaryen` npm package in `web/` (a dev
  dependency, so `_web-deps` installs it). A hand-written forward pass for
  the 3-block transformer is the M5-era option if the compile cost matters
  on the tablet.
- **The run agent** is `sts2_rs.HeuristicRunAgent` — the deployed
  `MctsCombatPolicy<HeuristicPolicy>` stepped one decision at a time
  (`RunAgent`), single-threaded, carrying its MCTS RNG and decision counter
  across pauses. `start-faithful` builds the run the PPO env's way
  (`Game::start_faithful`: integer seed via `hash_seed`, Neow start, the
  deck-mutation flags, Overgrowth); a hand-played run gets its agent lazily
  on the first `run-mode-step`. The step record, the `search` rows, the
  `debug` summary and the timeline labels (`to_workbench_verb` port) are
  the Python shapes.
- **Node values.** `Session::add_node` scores every non-combat, non-game-over
  node with the loaded net (the critic's V(s)); a save / IndexedDB restore
  replays the recorded values instead (`node_values`, and `value` per
  persisted node) so a long restore never re-runs the net. Under the `ppo`
  brain the map overlay's route is seeded on the net's pick, as the Python
  session does (`_driving_first_col`).
- **Run-mode runs** rebuild through the faithful constructor on seek /
  restore / persist import, and native-agent nodes (`__agent_native__`)
  replay through `take_action`.
- **No clock on wasm.** `wpa-verify`'s `max_seconds` deadline reads
  `Config::now_ms`, which the wasm shell wires to `Date.now`; native tests
  use `Instant`.
- The `ppo_impl` toggle is accepted for parity (`python|rust`) but the
  browser always runs tract; the panel hides the toggle in static mode.

## Replay viewer + deck analysis (M4)

`crates/sts2-workbench/src/runlog.rs` is `BranchingLiveSession.quit` +
`game_log.GameLogger` (the writer) and `timeline.py`'s `TimelineStore` +
`aggregate.py` (the reader); `replay.rs` mounts `/api/timeline`, `/api/map`,
`/api/step/{idx}[/deck-analysis]`, `/api/deck/trend`,
`/api/deck/reward-preview`, `/api/live/deck-analysis`, `/api/recommend`,
`/api/search_tree`, `/api/regret-review`, `/api/wpa-review` and
`/api/live/from_replay`; `deck.rs` is `deck_analysis.py`.

- **The log.** `POST /api/live/quit` writes the active path as the same
  `{step, ts, type, data}` records Python writes (identity header with
  `run_mode` / `act1` / `backend`, a `state` per node, each `action` with
  its native args + display label + replayable verb, `combat_log` rows,
  the `wpa` values, the terminal `summary`). The worker stamps `now`, keeps
  the text under its filename (`{stamp}_{character}_{seed}.jsonl`) in the
  `runs` store, lists it newest first (`/api/runs`, `/api/runs/stat`) and
  hands it back to `Workbench::load_run` on `/api/load`; `/api/mcts-runs`
  and its aggregate read every stored log.
- **The engine-backed replay routes rebuild the run.** Where Python
  re-scores a fight rebuilt from the rendered state through a lossy adapter,
  the port replays the recorded line to the step (the log carries the run
  identity and every action's replayable form) and searches the exact engine
  state — one forward replay for a whole regret review. Those three routes
  are structural twins in the golden parity (like the live regret coach);
  "play from here" is the same rebuild through `Session::load_line`.
- **Deck analysis** is bit-exact: `deck.rs` carries a port of CPython's
  `random.Random` (MT19937, `_randbelow`, `shuffle`) so the Monte-Carlo
  rollouts draw the same shuffles; the two tables (`card_db.json`,
  `card_tags.json`) ride in the data bundle (`just workbench-data` copies
  them from `python/workbench/data/`).
- The run log is written with the Python normaliser's action shape (a
  hand-played potion records `slot: null` — the M2 asymmetry stays in the
  live coach only), so a recorded line hashes like the oracle's.

## Persistence

IndexedDB `sts2-workbench`:

- `saves` — key = slug, value = today's `saves.py` payload
  (`schema_version: 1`, identity, `progress`, `step_count`, `line`,
  `node_values`). `saved_at` is injected by the worker's clock.
- `live/current` — identity + the branch tree **without node states** (but
  with each node's `value`, the run mode and its config) + the active leaf,
  rewritten after every mutating call. On load the worker rebuilds the root
  and replays the active path (progress frames drive the "Restoring run
  n/N" banner); other branches materialize lazily on `seek`.
- `runs` — the JSONL run logs finished runs leave behind, keyed by
  filename, `{text, size, mtime}` (M4).

`/api/live/quit` clears `live/current` and answers `{ok: true, log_path: null}`.

## Phone-speed probe (`POST /api/bench`)

`{sims, playouts, seed}` runs the hint endpoint's single-tree search
(`mcts_recommend`'s config, `threads=1`) over the live combat plus seeded
heuristic playouts, and reports the work done; the caller times it. In the
static build the transport is exposed as `window.__sts2ApiFetch` so a script
can call it from outside the bundle. Numbers: `sts2-rs/docs/perf/2026-09-02-browser-workbench-bench.md`.

## Bug reports

The Python workbench builds a report server-side and puts it in GCS
(`sts2-pycli/CLAUDE.md`, "Bug reports"). The browser build has no server, so
the roles move: the **page** builds the same schema-1 dump
(`web/src/bugreport.ts`) from what the worker exposes, and the **host** —
Cloudflare Pages — stores it through a Pages Function (`web/functions/api/`)
in a Workers KV namespace (`web/wrangler.toml`; deploy/DEPLOY.md has the
why-KV and the one-time setup). Same id format (`wb-` + 16 hex), same
`?report=<id>` view.

What differs is what a report carries, because the reporter's run exists
nowhere but in their IndexedDB:

- a **live** report carries the run's persisted tree (`GET /api/live/persist`,
  the payload a reload resumes from) plus the enriched step and the map;
- a **replay** report carries the run log's text (`GET /api/runs/read?path=`)
  plus the viewed step.

The report view's "Load into this workbench" takes either back
(`POST /api/live/import {persist}` replaces the live run and persists it, so
the reload resumes the reporter's run; `POST /api/runs/put {path, text}` adds
the log to the Runs list under `<report id>_<original name>.jsonl`). Those
four are host routes in `engineRoutes.ts`, not wasm ones.

The 🐞 Report button appears only where a capture would land: the SPA probes
`GET /api/bugreport` once and wants the Function's JSON (`{ok: true}`) — the
SPA fallback of a plain static host and `vite preview` answer HTML / 404 and keep it hidden.
From the desk, `just bug-reports` lists the store and `just bug-report <id>`
downloads one (a replay report's log unpacks to `logs/bugreports/<id>.jsonl`,
which the desktop workbench opens).

Abuse budget: Pages' free plan has no rate-limit binding, so the caps are a
20 MiB body, a same-origin check on POST, and KV's own 1,000 writes/day — a
flood costs a day of lost reports, never money.

## State import

Press **📋 Import state** and paste a run position copied out of the live game
(Spire Mentor's **Copy state** / `Ctrl+Shift+C`, or an advisor log — the newest
position in a pasted log wins). The dialog previews which run it is and what
the import will and will not reproduce *before* it replaces the run you have
open, then rebuilds it in the wasm engine.

Two lanes, as on the desktop. The **run lane** reconstructs the position on
the real seed's maps, and the deck, relics, potions, gold, HP and every RNG
cursor are grafted on from the paste, so the next card reward, shop and event
roll are the ones your run was about to get. It parks on the node you were
standing on. The **combat lane** (GH #708) resumes the exact fight — the hand,
the draw / discard / exhaust piles in order, every power, every intent, the
energy and the block, plus the game's own RNG lineage — bit-identical to the
board on screen. The dialog offers it whenever the paste carried a fight the
adapter could translate ("auto" prefers it), and the **open in SimLab** handoff
loads the same board into the sandbox.

The port lives in `sts2-rs/crates/sts2-workbench`: `state_import.rs` is the
paste parser (of `python/workbench/state_import.py`), `combat_import.rs` is
the mod-wire → engine-wire adapter (of `realgame_adapter.to_headless_combat_play`
+ `sts2_hint.adapter.translate`, composed into one pass over the mod's
objects; the title maps come from the embedded localization, the id checks
from the engine registries), `Game::start_imported` is the graft (of
`RustGame.start_imported`), and `/api/live/import-state[/preview]` are the
routes (of the Python endpoints). The graft order is load-bearing — place on
the map, empty the deck **before** granting relics (Whetstone / War Paint
upgrade on landing), deck then upgrades, HP/gold, RNG cursors, and the fight
last of all (`RunManager::debug_enter_combat`: the rebuilt `CombatState`
dropped onto the run as it stands, nothing re-rolled) — and
`Session::start_imported` keeps the snapshot, fight included, so `seek`, a
reload and a named save all rebuild through the graft rather than as a fresh
seed run.

One difference from the desktop is deliberate: there the combat lane is a
bare fight with no run behind it (`ImportedCombatBackend`); here the fight
sits on the run the run lane rebuilt, so when it ends the reward screen and
the map are there — on whatever node the paste placed the run (a fight paste
carries no map, so that is the act entrance, and the warning says so). Nothing
is guessed: a field the paste omits (no map, no RNG) becomes a warning shown
above the board, because a half-restored state that *looks* whole is the
expensive failure. The adapter keeps the desktop's fail-loud / soft-drop
split — an unknown monster or orb refuses the fight (the run lane still
imports, with the reason), an unknown card / relic / power / potion is
dropped — but where the desktop counted drops into a tally nobody read, every
drop here is a named warning, as is a pet with no engine representation.
`tests/state_import_combat_parity.rs` pins the adapter against the Python
chain's wire dicts for every real capture under
`sts2-pycli/tests/fixtures/realgame_adapter/`
(`just state-import-golden-dump` re-records them).

## SimLab sandbox (M5)

`/simlab.html` is a position editor with no run behind it: set up a fight
(character, ascension, turn, encounter, seed), edit the player (HP, block,
energy, relics, potions, powers, orbs), lay out each pile — the draw pile **in
order** — and each enemy with HP, block, powers and its telegraphed move, then
ask the engine two questions. Every edit re-asks the engine to build the board
(the **Position** card says "Built." or names the field it refused); **search**
runs the workbench's MCTS on the board and returns win probability per first
move. You can paste a position in, deal a fresh fight, or hand-author one.

The distribution **sweeps** ("play it out" as a distribution / CDF / box
charts, and the Studies tab's deck × encounter × ascension batches) run in
the browser too since GH #707, so `capabilities.features.simlab_sweeps` is
`true`. On the desktop a sweep is a background job over a process pool with
its state on disk; the wasm is single-threaded and has no threads, files or
clock, so `simlab_sweep.rs` makes it a **host-stepped job**: the Web Worker
calls `Workbench::sweep_tick` (plays trials for ~50 ms), yields to its message
queue — so a status poll or the sandbox's own search queued meanwhile is
answered between trials and the page never freezes — and enqueues the next
tick until nothing is running (`engine.worker.ts::pumpSweeps`). **Stop** sets
a flag the next trial honours; the desktop's 10-minute wall-clock cap applies
(`stopped_reason: max_runtime`). Finished sweeps — and, every few seconds, the
running one — are exported to the `sweeps` IndexedDB store, so the history
survives a reload (a sweep cut by a reload comes back `cancelled` with its
partial rows). The strategies (`random`, `block_first`, `attack_first`,
`min_overblock`, `mcts`), the seed pairing, the row schema and the bucket
statistics are ports of `simlab/{runner,agents,intel,telemetry}.py` and
`app._kde`; `tests/sweep_parity.rs` replays two small sweeps and compares the
rows and the results payload against the Python runner's
(`just simlab-sweep-golden-dump` re-records `tests/golden/simlab_sweep.json`).
The `random` strategy carries CPython's `random.Random` (the `deck.rs` port), so
even its rows match. One deliberate deviation: an unknown strategy is a 422 at
submit, where the desktop runner would have produced a row of errors.

Importing a paste accepts a `simlab-position/1` document, an engine wire
dict, or a live-game Spire Mentor fight paste (translated through the same
`combat_import.rs` adapter the state-import combat lane uses; a fight the
engine cannot rebuild is refused with the reason).

The port lives in `sts2-rs/crates/sts2-workbench`: `simlab.rs` is the
position ↔ wire logic (of `python/simlab/position.py`), `simlab_catalog.rs` is
the catalog + move/encounter tables (of `catalog.py`), and
`GET /api/meta`, `GET /api/simlab/catalog` and
`POST /api/simlab/position/{build,new,import,moves,mcts}` are the routes (of
`python/simlab/web/app.py`), plus `POST /api/sweeps`, `GET /api/sweeps`,
`GET /api/sweeps/{id}`, `POST /api/sweeps/{id}/stop` and
`GET /api/sweeps/{id}/results` (of the same file's sweep half + `jobs.py`,
in `simlab_sweep.rs`). The correctness-critical fresh-fight construction
is the **shared** `sts2_wire::scenario::build_scenario_state` — lifted out of
`sts2-py` so the Python parity oracle and the browser build boards
byte-identically — while the wire round-trip and the MCTS are the same
pure-Rust `sts2_wire` emitters the advisors already use. The whole
`web/src/simlab/` SPA was already built for the desktop server; the browser
change is routing its `/api/*` calls through the worker transport
(`src/simlab/api.ts` → `apiFetch`).

## Live-game bridge (GH #709)

The live-game views — the **Game tree** of the real run (click a save point
to rewind the actual game), **Live search** over the live board, and **rewind
to the viewed floor** — talk to the advisor's control plane (the Spire Mentor
mod's rewind lane: `GET /status`, `/tree`, `/snapshots`, `POST /restore`,
`/search_tree` on `127.0.0.1:8079`, `sts2-pycli/python/realgame_control.py`).
The Python workbench reached it through a same-origin proxy (`/api/bridge/*`);
the browser build has no server, so the page calls the control plane itself:
a cross-origin fetch from `https://your-workbench.example.com` to a loopback
`http://` address. Whether a browser allows that was the open question.

### The transport question, measured (2026-09-08)

`sts2-pycli/scripts/spike_bridge_transport.py` starts two fake control
planes on loopback — one with the page origin allow-listed, one without —
and `web/scripts/bridge-transport-spike.mjs` loads the **real deployed page**
in Playwright's browsers and fetches both from it (`GET /status`, a simple
request, and `POST /restore` with a JSON body, which preflights):

| Browser | Control plane with the opt-in (CORS + PNA headers) | Without |
|---|---|---|
| Firefox 151.0 | **works**: GET and the preflighted POST, `127.0.0.1` and `localhost` | blocked (`Access-Control-Allow-Origin` missing) |
| Chromium 149.0.7827.55 | blocked in headless: `Permission was denied for this request to access the loopback address space` — Chrome's **Local Network Access** permission (a prompt in a headed browser; the fetch waits on it, so a headed run under xvfb hangs on the prompt). With that check off (`--disable-features=LocalNetworkAccessChecks`, i.e. the permission granted) **works**: GET and the preflighted POST | blocked (CORS) |

So the three gates the issue named resolve as: **mixed content** is not a
blocker (a loopback `http://` target is exempt in both browsers);
**CORS** is, and is answered by the control plane's opt-in; **Private Network
Access** in current Chrome is a user permission rather than the
`Access-Control-Allow-Private-Network` header alone — the header is sent
too, and the page passes `targetAddressSpace: "loopback"` on its requests
(Chrome's hint), but the user has to allow the prompt once. Viable, with
two opt-ins, both off by default.

### The setup

1. **On the advisor** (the machine running the game): allow this page's
   origin. In the mod's settings, **Browser workbench origin** =
   `https://your-workbench.example.com` (`SpireMentorModConfig.BrowserWorkbenchOrigin`
   → the advisor's `--control-allow-origin`), or pass the flag yourself.
   The control plane then answers that origin — and no other — with
   `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` (echoed, never `*`), the methods / headers
   allow-list, `Access-Control-Allow-Private-Network: true` and a
   `do_OPTIONS` preflight; with no origin listed it sends no CORS headers at
   all, so no web page anywhere can read it (the same-machine proxy never
   sends an `Origin` and is unaffected). `tests/test_realgame_control.py::TestBrowserAccess`
   pins both halves.
2. **In the page**: Tools → **🎮 Live game…**, enter the control plane URL
   (default `http://127.0.0.1:8079`; the game's machine if that is another
   one), connect. `src/bridge.ts` keeps it in `localStorage`; nothing is
   probed until a URL is set. The status probe then runs in every view (not
   only the replay of an advisor log, which the browser build cannot follow),
   and the Analyze menu grows **Game tree** and **Live search** while the
   advisor answers `connected`; **rewind to the viewed floor** stays a replay
   command (it needs a viewed floor). The Tools entry shows the state
   (`connected` / `unreachable`), and the dialog shows the probe error.
3. **In Chrome**, allow the "access devices on your local network" prompt
   the first request raises. Firefox does not ask.

The proxy's routes mapped 1:1 onto the control plane's; the one transform it
did — rendering each tree node's `combat_log_raw` with the localization —
is the wasm's `POST /api/bridge/render-tree` (`enrich::log_names` +
`combatlog::format_combat_log`, the same formatter a simulated run goes
through). `/api/bridge/status` and friends stay 501 in the worker: with a URL
configured, `api.bridge.*` never goes through it.

## What is not there yet (roadmap)

| Milestone | Scope |
|---|---|
| M2 | **Shipped** (see "Advisors"): the search-backed and rollout advisors over worker RPC, streamed progress. |
| M3 | **Shipped** (see "Run mode"): PPO in-browser, run mode / autobattle, node values, WPA review + verify, run-mode saves. |
| M4 | **Shipped** (see "Replay viewer"): run logs on quit, the replay viewer and its reviews / searches / play-from-here, the MCTS Runs page, deck analysis. |
| M5 | **Shipped**: bug reports, state import (both lanes since GH #708), the SimLab sandbox and — since GH #707 — the SimLab distribution sweeps (see those sections). |
| M6 | wasm threads (COOP/COEP: the `/*` block in `sts2-pycli/web/public/_headers`; `crossorigin` on art elements only for a remote art origin). |
| M7 | Android TWA; native `sts2-coach` binary over `Workbench::call` for the Spire Mentor lane. Then retire the Python workbench modules and `deploy/`. (The live-game views already reach the advisor directly — see "Live-game bridge".) |

Known M1 limits: single restore attempt on load; `size_jitter` / `hue_jitter`
are the only floats in the wire; the `csharp` backend dialect and
`start_faithful` are not ported. `start_imported` and the `force_*` /
`debug_*` graft ARE ported now (M5, both lanes since GH #708 — see "State
import").
