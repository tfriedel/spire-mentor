// SimAdvisor.cs -- phase 6: the observe-and-advise loop.
//
// While SimRuntime.Mode == Advisor, a HUMAN plays the game and this class:
//   1. watches for decision points via PUBLIC game events (no Harmony):
//        - CombatManager.PlayerActionsDisabledChanged -- the exact "the
//          human may act now / no longer" edge (better than TurnStarted
//          alone: also covers mid-turn animation blocks),
//        - CombatManager.TurnStarted,
//        - CombatManager.History.Changed -- what did the human just do
//          (typed CardPlayFinishedEntry), which also means the board
//          changed and standing advice is stale,
//        - ActiveScreenContext.Updated -- screen opened/closed,
//   2. debounces them (events arrive in bursts while effects resolve),
//   3. extracts the SAME combat_action board the autopilot lane sends
//      (SimCombatHandler.BuildCombatState, one builder -- a second shape
//      would drift), wraps it as an `advice_request` (PROTOCOL.md v3),
//   4. sends it through BridgeServer's non-blocking advice lane, and
//   5. renders the correlated `advice` reply in SimHud -- unless the human
//      already moved (state_id mismatch / superseded request), in which
//      case it is dropped.
//
// Human actions are reported outbound as `human_action` (fire-and-forget)
// and recorded in the action log with the advice that was on screen.
//
// v1 scope: advice for COMBAT decisions. Non-combat screens (card reward,
// shop, rest, map) clear standing advice but do not request their own yet
// -- their payload builders live inside AutoSlayer's blocking handlers and
// need extraction first (the "per-screen advice" follow-up).
//
// The game is NOT paused while the human thinks: player choices suspend
// the action queue via TaskCompletionSource (GameAction.cs), SceneTree.
// Paused is never assigned -- so advice computes and renders while the
// screen sits open.
//
// Threading: game events fire on the main thread; advice replies arrive on
// the bridge's socket thread. Anything touching game state or the scene
// tree runs on the main thread (Callable.From(...).CallDeferred). Never
// throws into the game's event dispatch; never blocks it.
