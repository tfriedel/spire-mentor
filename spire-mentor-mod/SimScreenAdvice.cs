// SimScreenAdvice.cs -- describe (and drive) the non-combat decision screen
// a HUMAN is looking at, for advisor mode.
// Originally ported from zhiyue/sts2-rl-agent (STS2BridgeMod); rewritten clean-room.
//
// Autopilot never needs this: SimCardSelector/CardSelectCmd.Selector bypasses
// these screens entirely, so the AI answers an ICardSelector callback and no
// UI exists. In advisor mode the opposite is true -- the real screen is up and
// the player is staring at it -- so advice has to be built FROM the live
// screen nodes, and "AI takes this decision" has to click them.
//
// Screen -> click recipes are the ones the game's own AutoSlay handlers use
// (v0.107.1 decomp):
//   NCardRewardSelectionScreen: UiHelper.FindAll<NCardHolder> +
//     holder.EmitSignal(NCardHolder.SignalName.Pressed, holder)
//     (SimCardRewardScreenHandler.cs, verified in live sweeps)
//   NCardGridSelectionScreen and subclasses (simple select, deck upgrade /
//     transform / enchant, choose-a-card): UiHelper.FindFirst<NCardGrid> +
//     grid.EmitSignal(NCardGrid.SignalName.HolderPressed, holder), then
//     %Confirm if the screen requires manual confirmation
//     (SimpleCardSelectScreenHandler.cs:36-70).
