// SimStateExtractor.cs -- shared, full-fidelity state extraction helpers.
//
// New file, not present in the donor. Phase 1a of the bridge plan: every
// outbound decision message previously hand-rolled its own subset of card/
// creature/relic/potion/run fields (see phase1-current.md's audit, section
// 3, "Serialization helpers -- inventory of duplication/inconsistency").
// This file centralizes that into one set of static, JSON-serializable
// extractors so every handler emits the same rich schema instead of N
// slightly-different ones.
//
// Design constraints (see docs/plans/2026-07-10-real-game-bridge.md phase 1a):
//   - "C# stays dumb": raw extraction only, no auto-resolution/decision logic.
//   - Direct typed member access preferred over reflection everywhere --
//     every field this file reads turned out to be public at v0.107.1
//     (verified against the decomp), with ONE exception: the cost model's
//     CardEnergyCost._localModifiers list has no public accessor, and
//     SafePersistentCost needs the per-modifier LIFETIME that no public
//     method exposes. That single field read is guarded and falls back to
//     "unknown" (null) rather than to a wrong number.
//   - Null-safe: any game subsystem may be absent (no orbs for Ironclad, no
//     pets, empty potion slots, no active combat for deck/master_deck
//     cards). Prefer ?. chains + defaults; a top-level try/catch per
//     "category" logs and emits {"error": "..."} for that category only,
//     never lets one bad field take down the whole message.
//   - Cheap per-decision: combat_action is sent ~4x/s. Nothing here is
//     quadratic over the map graph -- SerializeMapGraph is never called from
//     combat_action, only from run-level (per-screen) messages (map_select's
//     handler plus ApplyEnvelope's MapCarryingTypes).
//
// Card cost fields (see phase1-target.md section 4, "clever things worth
// stealing" #2): `effective_cost` calls the engine's own
// CardEnergyCost.GetAmountToSpend() rather than re-deriving discount/X-cost
// math ourselves.
