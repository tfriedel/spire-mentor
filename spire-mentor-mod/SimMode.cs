// SimMode.cs -- runtime operating mode + live settings layer.
//
// SimConfig (SpireMentor.conf) stays the authoritative, immutable, file-based
// configuration: the parity/win-rate sweep lane drives the mod purely through
// that file and must keep behaving identically. SimRuntime sits on top of it
// as the LIVE state -- initialised from the file at startup, mutable
// afterwards (BaseLib settings page, hotkeys, console commands), with a
// Changed event for the HUD/advisor to react to.
//
// Mode semantics:
//   Off       -- the mod is inert beyond the TCP server: no Harmony behavior
//                changes, no HUD, the game plays 100% vanilla.
//   Advisor   -- the HUMAN plays; the mod observes decision points, asks the
//                Python advisor for a ranking, and renders it. Must never
//                enable NonInteractiveMode/AutoSlay paths: with
//                AutoSlayerCheck active, Cmd.ScaledWait skips all waits and
//                CombatManager.Pause() no-ops -- unplayable for a human.
//   Autopilot -- the AI plays the whole run via SimAutoSlayer (the original
//                bridge behavior; what every sweep/eval harness uses).
//
// Autopilot is ARMED by the config file but only ENGAGES once an agent is
// actually connected (see AutopilotEngaged) -- until then the game stays
// completely vanilla, so booting with auto_start=true and playing by hand is
// safe. Leaving Autopilot at runtime (F8 / console / settings) stops the
// SimAutoSlayer rather than being refused.
//
// Startup mapping preserves every existing invocation: auto_start=true (the
// sweep lane) => Autopilot, auto_start=false => Off. A human launch then
// flips Off -> Advisor once the game is up if the persisted CoachOnAtLaunch
// setting allows it (MainFile.CoachOnWhenReadyAsync) -- never from
// Autopilot, never under advisor_autoplay.
