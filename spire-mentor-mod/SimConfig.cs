// SimConfig.cs -- SpireMentor runtime configuration.
//
// Port note: new file, not present in the donor (zhiyue/sts2-rl-agent bridge_mod),
// which hardcoded its port/character/timeouts. Modeled loosely on
// refs/STS2MCP McpMod.LoadPort()'s "read JSON next to the DLL, write a default
// if missing" idiom.
//
// Reads SpireMentor.conf (JSON). Read precedence: next to SpireMentor.dll first
// (dev machines and the climb tooling keep their existing conf), else
// %LOCALAPPDATA%\SpireMentor (the only place a packaged install under Program
// Files can write -- GH #380). All fields are optional; missing/invalid
// fields fall back to defaults. When BOTH exist the mod-dir one wins and the
// ignored path is printed as an error -- README.txt sends users to the
// %LOCALAPPDATA% file, so a leftover mod-dir conf otherwise makes their edits
// look inert. If neither file exists, a copy of SpireMentor.conf.template is
// written to %LOCALAPPDATA%\SpireMentor so the user has something to edit; the
// mod dir is never written.
