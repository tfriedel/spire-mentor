//! UCT MCTS engine for sts2-core (Phase 8, bead `sts2-rs-69p`).
//!
//! Classic 4-phase loop: Selection → Expansion → Simulation → Backprop.
//! Arena-allocated tree (`Vec<MctsNode>` indexed by [`NodeId`]) so children
//! are referenced as `u32` indices instead of `Box`/`Rc` — keeps a 1000-sim
//! search in a handful of allocations.
//!
//! ## Chance nodes and hidden information
//!
//! STS combat is stochastic (card draws, monster intent rolls). The search is
//! one tree with explicit chance nodes: an edge that advances any combat RNG
//! stream becomes a chance node whose outcomes are sampled and progressively
//! widened. Under the deployed [`HiddenInfoMode::BeliefDraw`] the root is a
//! belief state (unknown draw order canonicalized, RNG cursors reseeded), so
//! no single determinization is committed. (The v0.1.0 baseline was
//! single-determinization MCTS; it is long gone.)
//!
//! ## Selection and parallelism
//!
//! * UCT `Q + c_puct·sqrt(ln(N)/n)` by default; PUCT with a learned move
//!   prior when [`MctsConfig::use_puct_prior`] is set (the Ironclad run
//!   agent's elite and boss fights).
//! * Root parallelism via [`par_search`]: independent trees, root statistics
//!   summed. Every default deployment runs one tree.
//!
//! ## Transposition table (bead `sts2-rs-7z97`, W6)
//!
//! Optionally, on expansion the engine consults a transposition table
//! keyed on `(state_hash, depth_bucket)` (where `depth_bucket = min(depth
//! / 4, 255)` — coarse enough to merge near-by occurrences of the same
//! position, fine enough to keep turn-1 and turn-50 occurrences of the
//! same surface state separate). On a hit, the new edge is wired
//! directly to the existing node — the same node may then have multiple
//! parents, so the search graph becomes a DAG. Backprop walks only the
//! actual selection path each iteration ("sum into both paths"); the
//! shared node accumulates statistics from every path that arrives at
//! it, which slightly inflates visit counts but keeps the
//! implementation a one-line addition to the existing backprop loop.
//!
//! Keyed on [`sts2_core::search_hash`], which omits the RNG cursors, so
//! two paths reaching the same board merge even when they consumed
//! randomness differently. [`MctsConfig::use_transposition_table`] reads
//! as a gate but is not one — [`Mcts::with_policy`] forces it on for
//! every search; see that field's docs.

    ///    EndTurn into lethal because losing-fast keeps leaf_eval near
    ///    the starting position — see [`Self::lost_position_override`]
    ///    for the full rationale.
    /// 2. **Proven-win guard** (FINDINGS §5 guard 1, NOT gated by
    ///    [`MctsConfig::root_guards`] — it is exact): if any root
    ///    child is solver-proven winning ([`Node::proven_win`], the

    ///    unconditionally. Q statistics cannot outrank a proof; a

    ///    the visit tie-break to a well-visited coin-flip. Multiple
    ///    proven wins fall to visits, then rule 6's first-max.
    /// 3. **Score = mean value + GH #403 draw-window bonus.** The base
    ///    key is `argmax mean_value` (bead sts2-rs-trnu, plan §4.4,
    ///    Danihelka et al. 2020 arXiv:2007.12509: for `T > 0`,

    ///    — the rider is worth ~0.002 of leaf value, an order of

    ///    the search alone coin-flips it. Gated on
    ///    [`expert::has_live_draw_window`] so with no such card in hand
    ///    every score is `q + 0.0`, bit-for-bit the plain comparison.
    /// 4. **Tolerance tie-break** ([`MctsConfig::tie_eps`]): among
    ///    children whose score is within `tie_eps` of the best, the
    ///    most-visited child wins. UCT visit counts integrate value
    ///    information beyond the noisy Q mean — the A8 audit found

    ///    held 2×+ the visits of the Q-argmax while losing it by

    ///    preferring visits inside that band flips those plies
    ///    correctly (94/94 audited Ironclad plies). `tie_eps = 0`
    ///    restores strict-equality tie-breaking.

    ///    [`MctsConfig::root_guards`] and [`MctsConfig::tie_rules`]; GH
    ///    #1022). Entries run in order on the pick the entries above them

    ///    guards (FINDINGS §5 guards 2–3). When the band winner is
    ///    `EndTurn`, two ordered refinements may promote a `PlayCard` child whose
    ///    score is itself inside the band — never one outside it, so a
    ///    resolved Q gap always stands. (a) *Block guard*: telegraphed
    ///    enemy attack damage exceeds standing player block and an
    ///    in-band child's card grants block (`base_block > 0`, the
    ///    same key the GH #293 rollout ramp uses). (b) *Free-play
    ///    guard*: an in-band child's card costs 0 (or is
    ///    free-this-turn per [`sts2_core::hooks::card_cost_locally_zeroed`])
    ///    — ending the turn discards a strictly free option. Each
    ///    guard resolves multiple candidates by visits, then rule 6.
    ///    (c) *Junk-dispose guard* (any band winner, not just `EndTurn`):
    ///    on a discard / exhaust / mulligan choice, an in-band pick of a
    ///    curse (then a status) replaces a band winner that throws away a
    ///    real card — see [`junk_dispose_band_pick`].
