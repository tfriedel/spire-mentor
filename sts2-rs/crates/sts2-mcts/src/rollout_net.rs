//! The playout net: the playout's move choice made by a small trained
//! policy instead of the hand-written priority table in [`crate::expert`].
//!
//! Every simulation scores its tree path by one playout to the end of the
//! fight, so the playout policy is the judge of every candidate move. The
//! heuristic one is an STS1-ported card-priority list that plays out its
//! whole hand every turn; in long boss fights its playouts almost never
//! win, the search gets no win signal, and the pilot plays as if the fight
//! were already lost (GH #777 human-bank audit, 2026-10-18).
//!
//! The built-in Ironclad net (`rl2`) was first fitted to the search's own
//! moves, then trained by REINFORCE on playout outcomes from the starts of
//! human A10 boss and elite fights. Inside the deployed search it raised the
//! Ironclad full-run win rate by 4.67pp pooled over A0, A3, A5, A8, A9 and
//! A10 (1,200 paired runs, McNemar p = 3.6e-4; A9 33.5% → 43.5%).
//! `docs/experiments/2026-10-18-learned-rollout-fullrun-gate.md` has the
//! numbers. The built-in Defect net, trained the same way on Defect fights,
//! raised the Defect A9 win rate from 33.2% to 43.0% (A10 runs past act-3
//! boss 1, 400 paired seeds, McNemar p = 3.1e-4; GH #825,
//! `docs/experiments/defect-playout-net.md`). The built-in Necrobinder net
//! raised its A9 win rate from 9.2% to 15.2% (400 paired seeds, McNemar
//! p = 9.4e-4; GH #823, `docs/experiments/necrobinder-playout-net.md`), and
//! the Silent net from 15.8% to 22.2% (p = 3.8e-3; GH #824,
//! `docs/experiments/silent-playout-net.md`).
//! The Regent net shipped on the owner's call although its gate was NULL
//! (A0 +8.5pp, A9 +3.5pp at p = 0.12; GH #822).
//!
//! The model is a small factorized softmax, cheap enough to run at every
//! playout step:
//!
//! ```text
//! q(s)      = W2 · relu(W1 · s + b1 [+ Σ M[monster]]) + b2   (state query, D dims)
//! k(a)      = E[key(a)] + P · x(a)                           (action key, D dims)
//! logit(a)  = q(s) · k(a) + bias[key(a)] + w · x(a)
//! ```
//!
//! `s` and `x(a)` are fixed feature vectors computed here; `key(a)` is the
//! card (with its upgrade), the potion, `end_turn`, `choice` or `other`, so
//! each card learns its own embedding and bias. The trainer
//! (`sts2-pycli/python/ppo/rollout_learn.py`) reads the same features through
//! the `sts2_rs.rollout_features` binding, so training and playout can never
//! disagree on them.
//!
//! # Feature versions
//!
//! A weights file declares the [`FeatureVersion`] its features were computed
//! under (`feature_version`, absent = 1), and its `state_dim` / `action_dim`
//! must be that version's widths.
//!
//! - **v1** ([`STATE_DIM`] × [`ACTION_DIM`] = 32 × 24): the deployed net's
//!   features. A v1 file runs exactly the code it was trained under: every
//!   v1 feature, dot product and sum is computed in the same order as before
//!   v2 existed, so its logits are bit-identical (pinned by
//!   `tests/rollout_net_v1_golden.rs`).
//! - **v2** ([`STATE_DIM_V2`] × [`ACTION_DIM_V2`] = 96 × 32): v1 plus the
//!   boss flag, the act, the intent type of the first three enemies in play
//!   (alive, or a beaten sentinel such as the exploding Waterfall Giant),
//!   high-impact enemy powers (Artifact, Thorns, Plating, Ritual,
//!   Intangible, Slippery, Hardened Shell, Reflect, Curl Up, Enrage, sleep,
//!   minions, Vulnerable / Weak amounts) and player powers (Demon Form, Feel
//!   No Pain, Barricade, Corruption, Rage, Metallicize, Dark Embrace,
//!   Juggernaut, Inferno, Rupture, Aggression, Crimson Mantle, Flame Barrier,
//!   Vigor, Plating, Artifact, Buffer, Intangible, Thorns, Regen, No Draw,
//!   Entangled, temporary Strength); per action, whether the card exhausts
//!   (Corruption included) or is Ethereal, and the target's Intangible,
//!   Thorns, Slippery, Artifact, attack intent and block. The index of every
//!   feature is the `V2_*` constants below.
//!
//!   The act is NOT `CombatState::act_index`: a fight built by
//!   `build_scenario_state` (the human bank, the combat bench) always has
//!   `act_index = 1`, so a feature read from it would be constant in
//!   training and vary in deployment. A v2 file instead carries
//!   `monster_act` (species → the lowest act any encounter lists it in, via
//!   `sts2_rs.monster_acts()`) and, optionally, `encounter_act` (each
//!   encounter's `[act, roster]`, via `sts2_rs.encounter_acts()`). The act is
//!   the highest `monster_act` among every enemy the fight has spawned,
//!   raised to an encounter's act when its whole roster has been spawned: two
//!   constructs are act 1 alone and act 3 as the Construct Menagerie. The
//!   optional `monster_keys` / `monster_emb` table adds a learned per-species
//!   vector to the hidden layer for each of the first [`MONSTER_SLOTS`]
//!   enemies in play: an encounter-identity embedding.
//! - **v3** ("v1e", [`STATE_DIM`] × [`ACTION_DIM`], v1's layout): every v1
//!   feature at its v1 index, read the way the game shows the fight (GH
//!   #830 boss audit). A telegraphed attack is its displayed number
//!   ([`crate::enemy_eval::IncomingDamage::Effective`]: the dealer's
//!   Strength / Weak, the player's Vulnerable / Intangible, a back attack's
//!   ×1.5) wherever v1 reads one: `incoming` (state 10), `unblocked` (11,
//!   and action features 20 and 23), the incoming-lethal flag (13), the
//!   target's intent (action 18) and the heuristic-priority feature (21,
//!   whose HP-aware arms read incoming). `removed` (state 15) counts the
//!   forms an enemy still has to go through
//!   ([`crate::enemy_eval::enemy_hp_remaining`]). Because the layout is
//!   v1's, a v1 file (the built-in `rl2`) loads as v3 by changing only its
//!   `feature_version`; v1 files keep computing the v1 numbers.
//! - **v4** ([`STATE_DIM_V4`] × [`ACTION_DIM_V4`]): v1's features, read as
//!   v1 reads them, then a character and affliction block (GH #822
//!   follow-up: Regent's elite deaths ran 4× the humans' on a faithful
//!   simulation). The state adds Regent's Stars and Star powers, the
//!   player's Tainted, the enemies' Personal Hive and Vital Spark, and the
//!   afflicted cards in hand ([`V4_STARS`] on). A card play adds its Star
//!   cost, the Stars left after it, its Tainted stacks or other affliction,
//!   and an Attack target's Personal Hive ([`V4_X_STAR_COST`] on). A v1
//!   file zero-padded to these widths computes the v1 net's logits.
//! - **v5** ([`STATE_DIM_V5`] × [`ACTION_DIM_V5`]): v4's features, then a
//!   card-mechanics block read from [`sts2_core::card_mechanics`], the same
//!   for every character. Every built-in net keys a card to its own row, so
//!   another character's card — a generated Zap on an Ironclad, a Poke on a
//!   Silent — lands on the `<unk>` row or a row trained on a handful of
//!   plays, and v1's features describe it only by cost, type, base damage
//!   and base block: Zap is a 1-cost Skill that does nothing, and Poke a
//!   6-damage Attack scaled by the player's Strength even when no Osty is
//!   there to deal it (it then does nothing). The state adds the orb belt
//!   (capacity, orbs held, by kind), Focus, the player's own Osty (alive, HP,
//!   block) and the Lightning channeled so far ([`V5_ORB_SLOTS`] on). A card
//!   play adds the orbs it channels, by kind and resolved against X / the
//!   enemies / the Lightning so far, the orbs it pushes off a full belt, a
//!   belt-payoff flag with the orbs held, the Osty HP it summons, and
//!   whether it is an Osty attack, needs an Osty the player lacks, or is an
//!   Osty attack that kills through block ([`V5_X_CHANNELS`] on). A v1 or v4
//!   file zero-padded to these widths computes its own logits.
//!
//! Which weights a playout uses ([`net_for`]):
//! - `STS2_ROLLOUT_NET=<json>`, when set, for every character. This is the
//!   experiment path, and it fails loudly if the file does not load.
//! - Otherwise the built-in net of the fight's character
//!   (`sts2-rs/data/rollout_nets/<character>.json`, compiled in when present).
//!   Every character has one.
//! - A character with neither plays the heuristic playout unchanged.
//!
//! `STS2_ROLLOUT_TEMP` and `STS2_ROLLOUT_NO_EARLY_END` override the softmax
//! temperature and the early-EndTurn rule of the `STS2_ROLLOUT_NET` net only.
//! A built-in net always plays with the values in its file, so a variable
//! left over from an experiment cannot silently change the deployed search.
//! Each net is loaded once per process.
//!
//! A built-in net is compiled in only when its file exists
//! (`cfg(rollout_net_<character>)`, set by `build.rs`). A checkout without the
//! file still builds and plays the heuristic playout.
//!
//! The same format also carries a move prior ([`RolloutNetPrior`]): the
//! built-in Ironclad one (`sts2-rs/data/prior_nets/ironclad.json`,
//! `cfg(prior_net_ironclad)`, GH #830) is [`builtin_prior_json`]. It is not a
//! playout net, and [`net_for`] never returns it.
