//! Bridge wire JSON → [`PpoObs`] + candidate [`ActionDesc`]s.
//!
//! **Porting authority:** `sts2-pycli/python/realgame_ppo.py` — `_base_obs`,
//! `_base_metrics`, `_card_id`/`_vocab_card_id`, and the six
//! `_PPO_NONCOMBAT_BUILDERS` entries. That file is never modified by this
//! port; `tests/wire_obs_parity.rs` and the pycli-side differential harness
//! hold the two together.
//!
//! ## Why this module exists
//!
//! [`super::policy::build_obs`] builds the observation from a live
//! `RunManager` — the engine's own run state. The advisor lane has no such
//! object: SpireMentor sends the wire schema in `spire-mentor-mod/PROTOCOL.md` and
//! nothing else. That is the one piece of the PPO path with no Rust
//! counterpart, so the advisor has had to build the observation in Python,
//! dragging `numpy` + `onnxruntime` (~54 MB of the shipped bundle) along with
//! it. Everything downstream — [`super::encoder::featurize`], the tract
//! runtime in [`super::net`] — has been in Rust since the 2026-07-07
//! ppo-rust-inference plan.
//!
//! ## Faithfulness notes
//!
//! The Python builders encode a series of hard-won corrections, each of which
//! is reproduced here with its reason, because losing one is silent: the
//! observation still builds, the net still answers, and only the win rate
//! knows. In particular:
//!
//! * **The row-0 map guard.** `rm.map_coord()` is `None` at an act's first map
//!   choice, but the DLL reports the pre-act Neow/Ancient node (row 0) as
//!   `current` — a row its own act graph never contains. Feeding it through
//!   made `mapfeat` compute real forward cones where training saw the
//!   degenerate act-start encoding, flipping the act-start route on 27 of 42
//!   exactly-reproduced live decisions (2026-08-02 pathing diagnosis).
//! * **`total_floor` is `floor - act`, `act_index` is 1-based.** The DLL's
//!   `RunState.TotalFloor` sums `MapPointHistory`, which counts every act's
//!   start room (Neow, the Ancients) as a floor; the engine's
//!   `rm.total_floor()` counts none of them. So the offset is the 1-based act
//!   number: 1 at Neow (where it fed the encoder off-by-one on every meta
//!   decision — 4735/4735 in the v3x sweeps), 2 through act 2, 3 through act
//!   3 and the A10 second boss. A flat `- 1` left acts 2–3 one and two floors
//!   too deep (GH #1051; `shadow_replay.py` measured +1 / +2, a won A0 run
//!   reads 45 in the engine and 48 in the game).
//! * **`_STATUS` vocab suffix.** The registry disambiguates ids colliding
//!   with another registry kind by a suffix (`SLOTH` → `SLOTH_STATUS`) and
//!   the bridge sends the plain id. 407/6074 deck tokens went OOV before the
//!   fix. The `_CARD` half of that family (`RAGE` → `RAGE_CARD`) is now
//!   handled upstream — [`vocab::canonical`] strips a trailing `_CARD`, so a
//!   bare `RAGE` already lands on `RAGE_CARD`'s slot — but the lookup is kept
//!   in the same shape as `_vocab_card_id` so the two emit identical tokens.
