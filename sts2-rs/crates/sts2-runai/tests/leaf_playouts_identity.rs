//! Byte-identity pin for the deployed combat search (GH #830, deep bets
//! build 1).
//!
//! `MctsConfig::leaf_playouts` (default 1) adds extra playouts per search
//! leaf. At its default it must leave the search exactly as it was. This
//! file pins what the deployed search produced on the engine the knob was
//! added to (`2ecc2ba40`), blessed BEFORE the knob existed:
//!
//! - **Searches.** Fight states from fresh Ironclad runs, each searched at
//!   300 sims under the deployed config
//!   ([`MctsCombatPolicy::search_config`]): every root child's visit / win /
//!   loss / tie counts and the bits of its value, squared-value and HP sums,
//!   the chosen action, and the rollout counters.
//! - **A fight.** The first combat of a fresh run, played by
//!   [`MctsCombatPolicy`] at 1000 sims: every action and the final HP.
//!
//! Both pin the BASE dialect. The fixture searches take `search_config`
//! without a character (`None`), which is Ironclad's search with the off
//! switch: these are Ironclad states that play Ironclad's playout net, not
//! the other characters' search. The seed-5 policy fight runs under the two
//! off switches (`STS2_RUNAI_MCTS_OVERRIDES=<IRONCLAD_SEARCH_KNOBS_OFF>`,
//! `STS2_RUNAI_PRIOR_NET=off`) and must still match the golden blessed
//! before the Ironclad run-agent layer existed (GH #830). That golden is
//! insensitive to the layer: on seed 5 the knobs change no move and no root
//! visit, so it matches with or without the switches and only shows that the
//! switches change nothing there. The in-tree proof that the off switches
//! restore the old search is
//! `the_off_switches_play_the_pre_layer_search_where_the_knobs_bind` (seed 24,
//! golden key `policy_fight_seed24_pre_layer`), and
//! `the_ironclad_default_moves_the_policy_fight` pins that the shipped
//! default moved that seed-24 fight.
//!
//! A comparison of `leaf_playouts: 1` against `MctsConfig::default()` could
//! not fail: the default IS 1, so a bug in the `k = 1` path would move both
//! sides at once. The golden is what makes this a test. (The fixture
//! searches were blessed before `leaf_playouts` existed, so their config is
//! "the field not set"; the explicit `leaf_playouts: 1` arm compares against
//! the same pin.)
//!
//! Re-bless only when an engine or content change moves the search on
//! purpose (any card, monster or search change in these fights will), never
//! to make a `leaf_playouts` change pass:
//! `STS2_BLESS_LEAF_PLAYOUTS_GOLDEN=1 cargo nextest run -p sts2-runai --test leaf_playouts_identity`.
