//! `combat_position_book` — freeze a stratified position book with
//! method-independent gold answers (#446).
//!
//! Combat changes are currently gated on instruments that are either
//! noise-bound (win rate over a 30-run panel; the PPO screen is
//! documented blind below ~8pp) or narrow (`blunder_budgets.toml`
//! counts named pathologies, not decision quality). Nothing measures
//! "did the search pick the right move" across a representative set.
//!
//! The 2026-08-10 root-parallel study solved the hard part inside
//! `mcts_thread_agreement`: run a deep oracle **twice** — once
//! single-threaded, once root-parallel — and keep only positions where
//! both are unanimous across their own seeds AND agree with each other.
//! There the reference action is method-independent, so a `threads=1`
//! arm and a merged arm are judged against the same answer without the
//! shared-geometry bias that a single-threaded oracle would introduce.
//!
//! That study was a one-off, and it sampled synthetic random-deck
//! Ironclad positions on an Act-1 encounter mix. This binary makes the
//! method reusable and fixes the sampling:
//!
//! * **Real positions.** Entries come from the harvested on-manifold
//!   fixture pool (`logs/2026-08-12-fixture-pool/harvest.sh`) — real
//!   decks, relics and HP reached by actually playing runs, not 24
//!   cards drawn uniformly from the character registry.
//! * **Stratified.** Per character and per tier, because both matter.
//!   Boss positions are where #442's evidence is weakest (64.5% of boss
//!   decisions unresolved) and where the win-rate knee sits, but they
//!   are only ~8% of a raw harvest. Silent carries ~3x Ironclad's rate
//!   of transposition-merged root children (13.1% vs 4.6%), so an
//!   Ironclad-only book is not representative of anything.
//! * **Frozen.** The oracle pass is paid once and written to disk.
//!   Downstream A/Bs score against the stored answers.
//!
//! The output is the committed artifact; the fixture pool that fed it
//! is regenerable and git-ignored.
//!
//! ## What `gold_agr` cannot see, and what it is not
//!
//! The gold filter keeps only positions where **both oracles are
//! unanimous across their own seeds**. That is what makes the answer
//! method-independent, and it is also what makes the book blind to
//! near-ties: a position where the oracle is split is dropped, and a
//! split oracle is exactly the signature of two moves worth almost the
//! same. An aggregation, ordering or tie-break change fires precisely
//! there.
//!
//! Measured against the engine-proven ordering suite (`dominance_pairs`,
//! GH #492), a 50 000-sim search of this dialect picks the **provably
//! dominated** order on 19.0% of proven pairs — and a 50x budget increase
//! buys only 3.3pp on the block axis, so it is converged on an objective
//! that does not price those advantages rather than merely under-sampled.
//! More simulations will not fix it.
//!
//! **That does NOT mean `gold_agr` is 19% wrong.** The `annotate`
//! subcommand exists to check, and the answer for the committed books is:
//!
//! | book | entries | carry a proof | gold contradicted |
//! |---|---:|---:|---:|
//! | `combat_position_book.json` | 168 | 1 | **0** |
//! | `combat_position_book_v2.json` | 159 | 0 | **0** |
//! | `combat_position_book_v3.json` | 292 | 3 | **0** |
//!
//! The v3 row is the 2026-10-18 rebuild (GH #805; it was 303 / 2 / 0).
//! **v1 and v2 were not rebuilt and are stale**: 0/168 and 0/159 of their
//! positions realize to the state they froze once fixture combats carry
//! `player.character`, so their rows above describe books nothing can score.
//!
//! v1/v2 are verified against the belt-less pool (`data/run-fixtures/`);
//! **v3 is verified against the belt-carrying pool**
//! (`data/run-fixtures-potions/`, `just harvest-fixtures-potions`) — the
//! v2 book had zero positions with a potion available because the harvest
//! wrote `potions = []` into every fixture. Pass the right pool root or
//! every entry reports a hash miss. `logs/2026-09-05-book-v3/FINDINGS.md`
//! has the v3 build and baseline.
//!
//! The proof-bearing class is ~0.27% of decision points (741 proven pairs
//! out of 2,652,820 orderings tried across 216,000 positions), so a
//! 168-entry book contains almost none of it. `gold_agr` is not
//! contaminated by the class — it simply does not sample it.
//!
//! The practical consequence for anyone tuning against `gold_agr`: it is a
//! sound metric for *resolved* decisions and says nothing about the
//! near-tie class. Use `dominance_pairs` as the co-metric there; it is
//! oracle-free, so the two cannot share a bias.
//!
//! ## Motif tags
//!
//! Every entry carries `motifs` — the `sts2_cli::replay::motif` predicates
//! (incoming attack, lethal threat, free 0-cost play, power in hand, …),
//! plus `proven_pair` when the dominance enumeration found one and
//! `gold_end_turn` / `gold_potion` for the answer's shape. `mcts_book_sweep`
//! and the standing gate break agreement and resolution down per tag, so a
//! regression names the decision class it hit. Tags are written at build
//! time and refreshed by `annotate` — the position-only ones are a pure
//! function of the frozen state, so they never need the oracle re-paid.
//!
//! ## Per-child oracle Q (`oracle_q`) and regret
//!
//! Every entry also carries the oracle's **root table** — each legal
//! action's pooled mean value, standard error and visit count over the six
//! searches (2 methods × 3 seeds) that voted on the gold answer. That lets
//! a consumer price a miss instead of counting it: `mcts_book_sweep`
//! reports `regret = Q(gold) − Q(pick)` next to `gold_agr`, and the gate
//! pairs it. The reason it exists is the 2026-09-06 budget panel: the book
//! predicted the decision-level trade of an elite-focused budget exactly,
//! but agreement weights a coin-flip miss and a blunder the same, and the
//! run outcome did not (`logs/2026-09-06-budget-realloc/FINDINGS.md`).
//!
//! The table is written at build time. For a book built before the field
//! existed, `oracle-q` replays the same double oracle (same sims, seeds,
//! warm-up, dialect) and writes only `oracle_q`; the gold answers are
//! never rewritten, because every existing dump was scored against them.
//!
//! ## The hard book (`hard`): positions selected by playout, gold set by playout
//!
//! GH #494 step 2 (`logs/2026-09-07-blunder-diagnosis/FINDINGS.md`) showed
//! two things about the oracle books above. The per-child oracle Q is a
//! visit-count artifact across children of one root, so `regret` does not
//! price a miss; and the unanimity filter selects **easy** positions — 94
//! of the 142 positions the deployed agent missed on v3 are fights it wins
//! 100% of the time from gold *and* from every mis-pick. Agreement on such
//! a book rewards matching a 50k-sim visit attractor, not value.
//!
//! `hard` builds a book the other way round, oracle-free:
//!
//! 1. **Screen.** Every candidate is played out by the deployed 1000-sim
//!    agent from the position as it stands (no forced move), `screen`
//!    times with paired seeds. Only positions whose win rate lands inside
//!    `(band_lo, band_hi)` — default (0.2, 0.8) — are kept: the fight is
//!    still in doubt, so a first-move error can cost a win.
//! 2. **Gold.** At each kept position every *distinct* legal move (card
//!    identity + target, so two copies of a card in hand are one move) is
//!    forced as the first move and the agent finishes the fight `gold`
//!    times; the moves within `within` wins of the leader get `refine`
//!    more. Gold is the move with the highest win rate, HP at the end of
//!    the fight breaking ties. The whole table, the margin to the
//!    runner-up and a z for it are stored in `playout`, so a consumer can
//!    weight or filter by how well the position is resolved.
//! 3. **Pool.** Built from `data/run-fixtures-hard/` (`just
//!    harvest-fixtures-hard`): the belt-carrying harvest repeated at
//!    ascension 10 and at a 40-HP snapshot, the two knobs the v3 pool held
//!    at 0 and 70. Sub-pools are one directory level below the root and
//!    `fixture_rel_path` carries that level. Fixtures are realized at their
//!    own `[player].ascension` (`common::realize_fixture`); the v1–v3 pools
//!    carry none, so their hashes are unchanged.
//!
//! Every playout first **re-deals the hidden information** (unknown draw
//! order, hidden RNG streams; `sts2_core::blindfold::blindfold_root` seeded
//! by the playout), so gold is the move that wins most *over deals* — what
//! the player faces — and not the move that wins most on the one deal the
//! fixture happens to freeze, which is knowledge no honest search has. The
//! first hard book (2026-09-07) was built without this (`--no-determinize`;
//! `playout.determinized` absent) and its gold carried that clairvoyance;
//! see `logs/2026-09-07-potion-diagnostic/FINDINGS.md`.
//!
//! The units are the run's: win% and HP, from the agent that will be
//! scored. `gold_agr` on this book is "did the search find the move that
//! wins most often when the fight is close", and a pick of a second copy
//! of the gold card (`gold_aliases`) counts as agreement. `oracle_q` is
//! empty and `regret` reads `-`, deliberately.
