//! Full-path regression test for `SkittishPower` (PhantasmalGardener).
//!
//! C# `../sts2-wiki/decompiled/v0.107.1/MegaCrit.Sts2.Core.Models.Powers/SkittishPower.cs:56-69`
//! (`AfterAttack`): ONCE PER TURN, when a card-sourced (`ModelSource is
//! CardModel`) `ValueProp.Move` attack lands UNBLOCKED damage on the owner, the
//! owner gains `Amount` block (`ValueProp.Unpowered`). `:71-82`
//! (`AfterSideTurnEnd`) clears `hasGainedBlockThisTurn` on the non-owner side's
//! turn end — for a monster owner, the player's turn end.
//!
//! `PhantasmalGardener.cs:92` spawns the gardener with `SkittishPower(6)`. The
//! engine recorded that power (`sts2-core::monsters::on_spawn_self_buffs`) but
//! had NO listener body, so a live divergence corpus showed the targeted
//! gardener at world block 6 / mirror block 0 in all 6 records — search
//! over-valued every attack into a gardener by 6.
