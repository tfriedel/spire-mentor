//! Combat ↔ Run bridge — P9.0.c (bead `sts2-rs-tjn0v`).
//!
//! [`enter_combat`] materializes a fresh [`CombatState`] from the
//! per-run [`RunState`] + an [`EncounterSpec`] (the run-side identity
//! of a fight, see `sts2-rs-5mfyd`). [`exit_combat`] writes the
//! post-combat scalars that the run-side cares about (current HP,
//! per-relic counters) back into [`RunState`].
//!
//! The bridge lives in `sts2-content` (not `sts2-core`) because it
//! consumes the content-side [`build_ai`] dispatch — the dep direction
//! is `content → core`, so core can't reference content-side AI
//! factories directly. The encounter spec itself lives in
//! `sts2-core::encounters` (POD only: `kind` + `hp`), so this module
//! is the natural seam.
//!
//! Mirrors a thin slice of the Python pin
//! `sts2-rl-agent@01c094d:sts2_env/run/run_manager.py::enter_combat /
//! _setup_combat`. Out of scope at this pin (deferred to later P9
//! beads):
//!
//! - **Reward generation** on combat clear — that's P9.1.e
//!   (`sts2-rs-jyfvu`); `exit_combat` does not push any rewards.
//! - **Potion belt transfer** — `RunState` has no `potions`
//!   inventory field at the current pin; the combat-side
//!   [`sts2_core::PlayerCombatState::potions`] starts empty and is
//!   populated by potion-rewards once that lands.
//! - **`apply_pending_combat_gold_loss` drain** — obsolete/dead. It is
//!   exposed on `RunState` but has NO production caller (only its own
//!   unit tests reference it). DEBT's turn-end gold loss now mutates the
//!   live `state.gold` directly (C# `Debt.OnTurnEndInHand` ->
//!   `PlayerCmd.LoseGold`), and `exit_combat` reconciles run gold via
//!   `rs.gold = combat.gold`. The accumulator and this drain are dead
//!   and slated for removal.
//! - **RNG stream init** — [`enter_combat_from_roster`] clones the run's
//!   `rs.rng` ([`sts2_core::run_rng_set::RunRngSet`]) into the combat and
//!   [`exit_combat`] writes the advanced cursors back, so the combat reads
//!   the run's cumulative `MonsterAi` / `Shuffle` / `Niche` streams exactly
//!   as C#'s single persistent `RunState.Rng` does (bead `sts2-rs-jenwp`,
//!   M3b monster_ai). The legacy non-stream `CombatState::rng` is seeded
//!   deterministically from the run's master seed.
//! - **Relic mirror (`rs.relics` → `state.relics`)** — wired (bead
//!   `sts2-rs-pfiwm`). `RunState` tracks relics by
//!   [`sts2_core::RelicId`] (the generated Python-pin enum, 294
//!   variants) while [`sts2_core::Relic::kind`] is typed
//!   [`sts2_core::RelicKind`] (the combat-side enum, 290 variants).
//!   The two enums share variant names 1-to-1, so
//!   [`sts2_core::RelicId::to_relic_kind`] is a pure name projection
//!   (the only `None` arms are the five W9 Neow reward relics with no
//!   combat behavior — bead `sts2-rs-4rwv4`). `enter_combat`
//!   materializes one combat-side `Relic` row per run relic, in
//!   pickup order, seeding `counter` from `rs.relic_counters` (falling
//!   back to [`sts2_core::RelicKind::initial_counter`]); listeners
//!   self-guard on `state.relics`, so no per-relic wiring is needed.
//!   `exit_combat` flushes each combat relic's `counter` back into
//!   `rs.relic_counters`.

/// Build a fresh combat from `rs` + `encounter`.
///
/// What's wired:
/// 1. **Player HP / max HP**: copied from `rs.current_hp` /
///    `rs.max_hp` into `state.player`, then `init_player_creature`
///    mirrors them onto the player-Creature row.
/// 2. **Master deck → draw pile**: each card in `rs.master_deck` is
///    cloned and pushed via [`CombatState::add_card_to_draw_pile`],
///    which assigns a fresh [`sts2_core::CardUid`]. The draw pile is
///    LIFO at insert time (matches Python `insert(0, …)`); the
///    P9.1 shuffle bead reshuffles before turn 1.
/// 3. **Relics**: each `rs.relics` entry is mirrored into a combat-side
///    `Relic` row via [`sts2_core::RelicId::to_relic_kind`], in pickup
///    order, with `counter` seeded from `rs.relic_counters` (see the
///    module-level relic-mirror note). Bead `sts2-rs-pfiwm`.
/// 4. **Act snapshot**: `state.act_index` is set from `rs.act_index`
///    so listeners gated on act (LavaRock, FurCoat) see the right
///    value (`sts2-rs-mi67e`).
/// 5. **Enemies**: each [`encounter.members`] entry is spawned with
///    its declared `hp` (no RNG roll — the spec carries the resolved
///    value), tagged with its [`MonsterKind`], and wired with an AI
///    from [`build_ai`] using a derived [`SpawnPosition`]. On-spawn
///    self-buffs (`apply_creature_spawn_buffs`) fire per push.
/// Build the [`CombatState`] for an event-nested combat
/// ([`sts2_core::events::EventCombatRequest`]). Maps the request's
/// [`sts2_core::events::EventEncounter`] to its monster, rolls the
/// monster's starting HP off the run's shared `niche` stream, and runs the
/// shared [`enter_combat_from_roster`] assembly path — the spawn buffs
/// (`apply_creature_spawn_buffs`) apply each dummy's
/// `BattlewornDummyTimeLimit(3)` and MysteriousKnight's
/// `Strength(6)`/`Plating(6)` automatically.
///
/// **RNG parity:** C# `CombatState.CreateCreature` rolls each enemy's HP via
/// `creature.SetUniqueMonsterHpValue(side, RunState.Rng.Niche)` — one
/// `Niche` draw per enemy, even when `MinInitialHp == MaxInitialHp`
/// (BattleFriend V1/V2/V3 = 75/150/300, MysteriousKnight = 101 from
/// FlailKnight, FakeMerchantMonster = 165). [`roll_unique_max_hps`] is the
/// faithful mirror (same stream, same two-pass uniqueness), so this advances
/// the shared cursor exactly like a normal encounter entry and keeps the
/// event→combat path parity-aligned.
