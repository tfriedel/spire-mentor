//! The single canonical "apply a power to the player through the legacy
//! `state.player.powers` surface" helper shared by every monster module.
//!
//! Monster `effect_fn`s that debuff the PLAYER route through here (SELF-buffs
//! go through `card_effects::apply_power_to_creature`) so wire-side observers
//! — `state_to_dict`, the Python parity harness — see the power. Hook routing
//! (modify chains / Artifact negation) is intentionally bypassed, matching the
//! historical behaviour of the per-module copies this module replaces.
//!
//! Each of `act1_overgrowth` / `act1_underdocks` / `act2_hive` / `act3_glory` /
//! `shared` used to carry its own byte-copy of this helper. The mirror+legacy
//! union fix (below) was applied to the `act3_glory` copy only, so the other
//! four kept the legacy-only scan and its duplicate-power bug — bead
//! `sts2-rs-60kxh`. One implementation, imported five times, is the fix.
