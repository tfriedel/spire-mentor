//! Neow-pool Ancient relics — bead `sts2-rs-4rwv4` (W9).
//!
//! These relics live in the C# Neow option pool (`Neow.cs:67-103`) but
//! are absent from the pinned Python sim, so they have no factory in the
//! Python-ported pools (`common` / `uncommon` / `rare` / `shop_event` /
//! `event_reward`). Their `RelicId` variants are appended via
//! `scripts/scrape_relic_ids.py`'s `EXTRA_CSHARP_ONLY` list and ported
//! against the authoritative C# `RelicModel`s under
//! `../sts2-wiki/decompiled/v0.103.2/MegaCrit.Sts2.Core.Models.Relics/`.
//!
//! Coverage so far (W9a-e):
//! - **`NeowsTalisman`** — `after_obtained`: upgrade the first Basic
//!   Strike and first Basic Defend in the deck (`NeowsTalisman.cs`).
//! - **`WingedBoots`** — no pickup effect; a free-travel map relic
//!   (`WingedBoots.cs`). Granting it to `RunState.relics` is parity-clean
//!   at pickup; the free-travel counter is deferred (W9b) until the
//!   per-floor path harness needs it, so this module registers no
//!   listener for it.
//! - **`NeowsBones`** — `after_obtained`: shuffle the Neow valid-relic
//!   pool with `PlayerRng.Rewards`, grant the first 2 (RewardsSet with
//!   skipping disallowed = obtain all), then add 1 curse drawn via
//!   `Rng.Niche` (`NeowsBones.cs`). Bead `sts2-rs-wjuoi` (W9e).
//! - **`HeftyTablet`** — `after_obtained`: roll 3 distinct Rare cards
//!   from the character pool via `PlayerRng.Rewards`, offer a skippable
//!   1-of-3 select through [`RunState::pending_card_selects`], and always
//!   add 1 Injury curse (`HeftyTablet.cs`). Bead `sts2-rs-w6hdj` (W9d).
//! - **`PhialHolster`** — `after_obtained`: gain +1 max potion slot, then
//!   roll 2 random out-of-combat potions via the `CombatPotionGeneration`
//!   RNG and procure each (`PhialHolster.cs`). Bead `sts2-rs-zgy5m` (W9c).
//!
//! All five W9 Neow-pool relics now map to a `RelicId` and (where they
//! have a pickup effect) fire it; the W9 divergence at the Neow choice is
//! closed.
