//! Wire-format parse + `CombatState` reconstruction, with no `PyO3` in sight.
//!
//! **Bead:** `sts2-rs-92sk` (hint-T1) / `sts2-rs-osyf` (T2) — moved out of
//! `sts2-py` when the parse layer was generalised over [`WireValue`].
//!
//! This module implements the *fail-loud* schema parse for the JSON dict the
//! hint adapter (`sts2_hint/adapter.py`) and the SpireMentor advisor lane feed
//! in, plus the translation of the resulting [`ParsedState`] into a fully
//! initialised `CombatState`. Per the integration plan
//! (`docs/plans/2026-05-14-integrate-sts2-rs-mcts-hint-system-into-projects-sts2-sts2-c.md`,
//! §Extended wire schema), every unknown id, unmodelled power, or invariant
//! violation produces an error carrying the offending JSON path
//! (`player.relics[3]`, `deck.hand[1]: STRIKE_X`, `encounter[0].kind:
//! GHIBBET_MAW`, …).
//!
//! Two halves, unchanged in substance from when they lived in `sts2-py`:
//!
//! * **T1** — [`parse_state_dict`] validates the dict into the [`ParsedState`]
//!   value-object. No `CombatState` is built.
//! * **T2** — [`state_from_dict_impl`] translates [`ParsedState`] into a
//!   fully-initialised `CombatState` (player Creature wiring, monster
//!   Creatures, deck piles, powers, relics, intent history, …).
//!
//! What *did* change: the parse reads through [`WireValue`] rather than
//! `PyDict` directly, so the same code serves a Python dict and a
//! `serde_json::Value` with no interpreter in the process. `sts2-py` supplies
//! the `PyO3` implementation and maps [`WireError`] back onto its two Python
//! exception types; nothing about the Python-facing behaviour moved.
//!
//! `registry_names_for()` is colocated here because it owns the
//! canonical-name source-of-truth tables used by [`parse_state_dict`] to
//! recognise valid ids — keeping the two in one file means a new
//! `MonsterKind` variant added without updating the local registry mirror
//! fails both the recognition path and the introspection in the same
//! `cargo test` cycle, not just one of them.
