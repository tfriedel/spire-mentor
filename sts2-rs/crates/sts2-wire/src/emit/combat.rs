//! `CombatState` → the wire dict, plus the bridge-shape action /
//! pending-choice dicts and the hand previews.
//!
//! [`combat_state_to_value`] is the inverse of [`crate::state_from_wire`]. It
//! emits the canonical wire schema (`docs/sts2-hint-state-schema.json`, the
//! same shape [`crate::parse_state_dict`] accepts on the way in).
//!
//! Lossy by design — see the `state_equiv()` test predicate in
//! `sts2-py/tests/round_trip.rs` for the exhaustive list of fields
//! intentionally NOT round-tripped. The significant ones:
//!
//!   * `rng` (`Xoshiro256PlusPlus`) — only the wire-schema-recorded
//!     `rng.seed` survives; the in-process cursor is opaque.
//!   * `combat_log` (`TurnEvents`) — append-only buffer, not in the
//!     wire format.
//!   * Hook listeners — closure state on the relic / power buses,
//!     reconstructed lazily from the relic/power kinds on the next
//!     `apply()`.
//!   * `intent_history` — Rust's internal shape is private; the wire
//!     format only carries an i32-encoded summary which we re-emit as
//!     an empty list because `state_from_dict_impl` defaults it anyway.
//!
//! All other wire-schema fields are bit-faithful: the parsed state
//! emitted by `parse_state_dict(to_dict(s))` should match the parsed
//! state that produced `s`, modulo the dropped fields above.
