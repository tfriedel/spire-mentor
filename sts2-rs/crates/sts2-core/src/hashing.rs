//! Deterministic structural hash of [`CombatState`].
//!
//! Bead sts2-rs-uiq (P8-1): MCTS transposition tables and replay-trace
//! deduplication need a fast, deterministic hash of canonical game state.
//! This module computes one with `std::hash::Hasher` fed in a fixed,
//! sort-invariant order so two structurally identical states hash equal
//! regardless of internal `Vec` insertion order.
//!
//! **Stability contract:** the hash is stable across runs of the same
//! compiled binary (same git HEAD). It is **NOT** stable across pin
//! bumps — the hasher implementation and the set of fields fed into the
//! hash may both change between releases. Persistence to disk across
//! pin bumps is therefore unsupported; consumers must treat the value
//! as ephemeral cache key only.
//!
//! **Hasher choice (perf):** these hashes run once per MCTS node
//! expansion / chance-outcome dedup — the single hottest fixed cost of
//! a search after the rollouts themselves (SipHash was ~11% of all
//! instructions on the 2026-07-03 realistic-deck callgrind). We
//! therefore use a **fixed-seed** [`ahash::AHasher`] instead of the std
//! SipHash [`DefaultHasher`]: ~an order of magnitude cheaper per write
//! while keeping the deterministic-within-a-binary contract (the seeds
//! are compile-time constants, so two identically-stepped states hash
//! equal across processes of the same build).

///   * Per-pile card-uid contents, folded through an **order-invariant
///     commutative mix** (a wrapping sum of per-uid `splitmix64` values —
///     see [`pile_mix`]) so insertion order is irrelevant. Each pile is
///     hashed with its [`PileKind`] discriminant prefixed so a card moving
///     Hand→Discard produces a different hash even if the total multiset
///     is unchanged.
///   * Player scalars: `energy`, `max_energy`, `stars`, `current_hp`,
///     `max_hp`, `block`.
///   * Player powers, sorted by `(power_uid, kind discriminant, amount)`.
///   * The Defect orb belt (`orbs.capacity` plus each slot in FIFO channel
