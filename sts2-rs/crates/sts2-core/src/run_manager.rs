//! Top-level run orchestrator (skeleton).
//!
//! Ports the *structure* of Python's `RunManager`
//! (`sts2-rl-agent@01c094d:sts2_env/run/run_manager.py:182-450`) — the
//! [`Phase`] enum, the `RunManager` struct, and the phase / action API
//! surface — without porting any phase behavior. Bead `sts2-rs-zfmfz`
//! (P9.0.d) lights up the state-machine skeleton so downstream P9.0.e
//! (`sts2-rs-5fsbh` linear 3-room thin-slice map driver) and the rest
//! of the P9.0 phases can wire concrete transitions into the existing
//! `phase` / `take_action` slots without churning the public surface.
//!
//! ## What's intentionally NOT here
//!
//! - **No phase transitions.** `take_action` returns
//!   [`ActionResult::NotImplemented`] for every input. Per-phase
//!   `_enter_*` methods are added by individual phase beads.
//! - **No map.** `Phase::MapChoice` is the initial phase, but
//!   `get_available_actions` returns `[]` until P9.0.e ports the
//!   linear hand-coded map.
//! - **No combat bridge.** `combat` defaults to `None`; the
//!   `enter_combat` / `exit_combat` bridge (already landed in
//!   `sts2-rs-tjn0v`) is invoked by the future `_enter_combat` phase
//!   handler, not by `RunManager::new`.
//! - **No real RNG.** The legacy `rewards_rng_seed: u64` shim is set;
//!   the multi-stream [`crate::RunRngSet`] migration (bead
//!   `sts2-rs-ewm6b`) lands a follow-up that hangs the bundle on
//!   `RunState` directly.
