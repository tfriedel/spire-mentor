//! Defect orb mechanic — bead `sts2-rs-spy` (P7-7).
//!
//! Ports `sts2-rl-agent@01c094d:sts2_env/orbs/*.py` (or canonical STS
//! reference where the pin file is absent). Five orb types — Lightning,
//! Frost, Dark, Plasma, and the empty `Empty` slot — live in an
//! [`OrbSlots`] collection on [`crate::PlayerCombatState`]. The collection
//! exposes [`OrbSlots::channel`] (FIFO eviction at capacity),
//! [`OrbSlots::evoke`] (one orb), [`OrbSlots::evoke_all`] (every orb),
//! and [`OrbSlots::passive_tick`] (turn-end passive trigger for Lightning
//! and Frost).
//!
//! ## Canonical orb behaviours
//!
//! | Orb       | Passive (each turn end)              | Evoke (one-shot)                          |
//! |-----------|--------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
//! | Lightning | `3 + focus` to random alive enemy    | `8 + focus` to random alive enemy         |
//! | Frost     | `2 + focus` block                    | `5 + focus` block                         |
//! | Dark      | +`6 + focus` stored damage           | `6 + stored` damage to lowest-HP alive enemy |
//! | Plasma    | `+1` energy (turn start)             | `+2` energy this turn (no Focus)          |
//! | Glass     | `current_passive + focus` to all     | `(current_passive + focus) * 2` to all    |
//! | Empty     | nothing                              | nothing                                   |
//!
//! Glass orb (bead `sts2-rs-q89c8`) carries per-instance mutable
//! `current_passive: i32`, starting at 4 on channel. Each passive
//! tick deals `max(0, current_passive + focus)` to ALL alive enemies,
//! then decays `current_passive` by 1 (floor 0) — Focus modifies the
//! damage but NOT the decay. Mirrors Python pin
//! `sts2-rl-agent@01c094d:sts2_env/orbs/all.py:181-216`.
//!
//! Focus is read from the player's [`PowerKind::Focus`] stack; for Dark,
//! the +6 stored-damage passive scales additively as `6 + focus`, while
//! the evoke fires the accumulated value directly (no second Focus add).
//!
//! ## Slot mechanics
//!
//! [`OrbSlots`] starts at the canonical Defect baseline of 3 slots
//! ([`DEFAULT_ORB_SLOTS`]); Capacitor and Signal Boost grow capacity at
//! runtime via [`OrbSlots::add_slots`]. Channelling into a full
//! collection evicts the *oldest* orb first, mirroring Python's
//! `combat.add_orb` / `evoke_first_orb` ordering at pin `01c094d`.
