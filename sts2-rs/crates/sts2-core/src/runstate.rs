//! `RunState` reward queue + `Room` / `Reward` POD set — bead `sts2-rs-62t`
//! (P7-surf).
//!
//! Mirrors the reward-flow surfaces in
//! `sts2-rl-agent@01c094d:sts2_env/run/run_state.py` and
//! `sts2-rl-agent@01c094d:sts2_env/run/reward_objects.py`. This bead
//! only lands the plain-old-data types + the `RunState.pending_rewards`
//! field. The three reward-modifier hook channels
//! (`modify_rewards`, `modify_rest_site_heal_rewards`,
//! `modify_card_reward_options_late`) live in
//! [`crate::relic_effects`] alongside the rest of the relic hook bus.
//!
//! Scope of this module:
//!
//! - [`RoomType`] — full variant set from
//!   `sts2_env/core/enums.py::RoomType` (`MONSTER`, `ELITE`, `BOSS`,
//!   `SHOP`, `REST_SITE`, `TREASURE`, `EVENT`).
//! - [`Room`] — minimal `{room_type}` POD (extend with fields as the
//!   downstream retrofit beads need them).
//! - [`CardReward`], [`RelicReward`], [`Reward`] — the three reward
//!   shapes the audit `DreamCatcher` / `FresnelLens` /
//!   `WongosMysteryTicket` chain depends on. Other Python `Reward`
//!   subclasses (`GoldReward`, `PotionReward`, etc.) are TODO and will
//!   be added by the umbrella retrofit bead `sts2-rs-01o`.
//! - [`RunState`] — minimal struct hosting `pending_rewards` (extend
//!   with deck / map / gold / hp once those surfaces land).
//!
//! `RoomType` replaces the placeholder `relic_effects::RoomKind` shim
//! from bead `sts2-rs-2ax`; `AfterRoomEnteredFn` now takes a
//! [`RoomType`] payload directly.
