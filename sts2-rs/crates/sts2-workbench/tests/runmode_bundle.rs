//! GH #830: the browser run mode's `RunAgent` plays Ironclad with the run
//! agent's Ironclad defaults and every other character as before.
//!
//! The `runmode_*` goldens cannot show this: they search at 8 / 16 sims,
//! where the EndTurn widening cap binds for neither constant and the draw
//! widening rarely does, so they may come back unchanged either way. Here the
//! constructor path the browser takes (`RunAgent::new`: `eval_cheap`, then
//! the sims) plays a run's first combat at 1000 / 4000 sims twice: with no
//! `STS2_RUNAI_*` variable, exactly as the wasm build runs (its env lookups
//! always fail), and with the two off switches. Ironclad's searches must
//! differ, Silent's must not.
//!
//! The record of each decision is its action and the search it came from
//! (every root action's visits and values). The searches, not the moves:
//! these first fights are easy, and on seeds 1-8 the knobs never changed a
//! move of one. Since the card cost model stopped leaving zero-valued cost
//! keys on played cards, identical cards dedup as one draw outcome, so the
//! widening caps bind less often: of seeds 1-16 only 12 and 13 still move
//! the Ironclad searches (seed 6 did before). Seed 12 it is.
//!
//! The overrides are read when the agent is built, so the legs run in one
//! process. `STS2_RUNAI_PRIOR_NET` is read once per process; the first combat
//! is a hallway fight, where the built-in prior (elite and boss only) is off
//! either way, so that cannot hide a difference.
