"""Advisor backend for SpireMentor advisor mode (PROTOCOL.md section 5, v3).

The mod is the server; this client connects to it (same transport as every
other ``realgame_*`` driver) and answers ``advice_request`` messages with a
full ranked ``advice`` payload. It never sends game-driving verbs: advice
is rendered by the mod's HUD, never executed by this process (the phase-7
takeover executes game-side).

Pipeline per ``advice_request`` (combat only in v1):

1. Reinterpret the payload as the ``combat_action`` snapshot it wraps
   (``advice_for`` field) and translate it with
   :func:`realgame_adapter.to_headless_combat_play` — the same path the
   autopilot MCTS driver uses.
2. Run the deployed honest-search configuration
   (``hidden_info="beliefdraw"``, ``c_puct=2.5``, ``draw_widening_c=2.0``,
   and the run agent's EndTurn widening 5.787 / 0.436, which the engine
   applies with the mode — NOT the leaky clairvoyant default) via
   ``sts2_rs.mcts_recommend``, keeping the raw result so the principal
   variation survives (``recommend_all`` drops it).
3. Map the ranked rows through :func:`sts2_hint.recommender.tags_from_result`
   and build the wire ``advice`` object: ``p_win``, ``best`` (executable),
   ``options[]`` (label / p_win / q / visits / visit_share / W-L-T /
   is_best / low_confidence / card_index / target_index), ``pv``.

``human_action`` messages and every advice exchange are appended to a JSONL
log under ``--log-dir`` for the phase-9 review pipeline. Never-crash
policy: any per-request failure is logged, answered with an empty advice
object (the HUD just shows nothing), and the loop continues. Messages this
process does not understand (e.g. autopilot decision messages if it is
accidentally connected to an autopilot session) are logged and ignored —
it must never answer them.

    The forward pass is the point of the third gate, not the load:
    constructing the policy only parses the graph, while ``ppo.vocab``'s
    registry build (``sts2_rs.list_registry_names``), the featurizer and the

    Every champion is loaded because the manifest resolves per character,
    and four of the five were never touched.

    The type assertion is load-bearing, not decoration: the bundle ships
    neither numpy nor onnxruntime, so a resolver that fell back to

    # often than the single-tree search the champion was trained with — i.e.
    # the threads win was being paid for in decision quality. Restoring it via
    # sims is nearly free HERE specifically: unattended pacing is ~0.5 s per
    # decision (SimAdvisor.cs debounce 0.10 + grace 0.15 + WaitTime 0.25) while
    # the think is tens of ms.
    #
    # 8000 (not 4000): at threads=8 that is 1000 sims/tree and agrees with the
    # 50k oracle 0.896 of the time vs 0.855 at 4000 — +4.1 pp on every combat
    # decision, for 136 ms/search vs 68 ms. 8000 is also where the measured
    # grid STOPS; do not raise it further without extending that grid.
