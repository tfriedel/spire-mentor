"""A persistent per-fight engine mirror for the live ADVISOR lane.

Why
---
The advisor is *stateless*: every decision it throws the fight away and
rebuilds the board from the snapshot the mod just sent. The autopilot is not
-- it keeps a :class:`combat_mirror.CombatMirror` running alongside the fight.
Three things live only in that mirror, and the advisor therefore never had
them:

1. **The open choice and its suspended tail.** Burning Pact is "exhaust a card
   THEN draw 2"; the engine holds that tail as the parked
   ``PendingChoice.post_effect``. A choice injected onto a freshly rebuilt
   board has ``post_effect: None``, so a search over it ranks the exhaust
   while believing no draw follows. That is a confident wrong answer, which is
   worse than the leftmost-card default it would replace -- amputating
   ``post_effect`` was 60 of 188 power divergences on the v27wr sweep.
2. **Hidden per-turn counters** (GH #370). ``card_plays_started_this_turn``,
   ``shivs_played_this_turn``, ``generated_cards_this_combat``,
   ``stars_gained_this_turn``, ``vigor_latch_card``: none is emitted by
   SpireMentor, so a rebuilt board reads them as 0 forever. Some are legality
   gates (``RingingPower.ShouldPlay`` / ``SlothPower.ShouldPlay``), so a stuck
   value changes which actions the search believes exist.
   ``transplant_hidden`` carries them; only a carried mirror has them to carry.
3. The true RNG cursors and undisclosed relic/power counters, same mechanism.

What this does NOT buy
----------------------
Clairvoyance. The mirror holds the true draw order, which makes it the one
object forbidden from searching with it -- :meth:`CombatMirror.search` refuses
a clairvoyant profile outright. Both lanes still search under ``beliefdraw``.

OBSERVE, not STRICT
-------------------
The autopilot's mirror watches a policy; this one watches a *human*, who may
play a card nobody recommended, rewind, or walk away. OBSERVE is the mode for
that: a divergence tags the mirror and re-seeds from reality instead of
raising. A dropped mirror costs advice quality for the rest of the fight --
which is exactly where the advisor already sits permanently -- so the floor
does not move and the ceiling does.

Lifecycle
---------
Seeded/reconciled on every combat ``advice_request``; dropped on a fight
change, on ``snapshot_restored`` / ``combat_undone`` (the mod broadcasts both
for *any* rewind, including ones the human triggers from the in-game toolbar),
and at ``game_over`` / ``run_complete``.

        The two mechanisms that keep the mirror in step collide exactly once

        1. To answer a `card_select` the advisor REPLAYS the opening play in
           its mirror (:meth:`replay_opening_play`), then drops the mirror --
           it is parked on an injected choice that nothing will ever resolve,
           because the advisor does not execute.
        2. The mirror re-seeds from the next combat board, which ALREADY
           reflects that play.
        3. Only then does the world report the play, because
           `CardPlayFinishedEntry` fires when a play FINISHES and a
           choice-opening card finishes only once the selection is answered
           (PROTOCOL.md section 7).

        Following step 3 would be following a card the re-seeded mirror no
        longer holds: `"<CARD> not in the mirror's hand to follow"`, and a
        second drop of a mirror that was correct. Two re-seeds per searched
        select, both avoidable.

        Guarded on the seed generation, not just the card: the suppression is
        honoured only if the mirror really was rebuilt since the replay. If it
        somehow was not, the play is still live and must be followed normally
        -- swallowing it there would put the mirror one card behind and say
        nothing, which is the failure mode this whole class exists to avoid.

        ``round`` has moved. So at the screen the mirror is still in the play
        phase and never parked itself. Live run 001-silent-a8-0825-0104: 146
        declines, every one of them this power, against 122 ranked decisions
        in the whole run -- 77% of everything the advisor had to rank.

        ``end_turn`` runs past the boundary and into the NEXT turn's setup, so
        a turn-START screen is this path's too. Tools of the Trade is the one
        that matters: its power draws +1 and then opens a ``FromHandForDiscard``
        inside ``AfterPlayerTurnStart`` (``ToolsOfTheTradePower.cs:27-37``), and
        the engine parks ``discard_from_hand`` there. Accepting only the retain
        kind sent 9 of them to the heuristic in the ``logs/f7-mirror-check15``
        corpus.

        ``TO_DISCARD`` in those logs is the PROMPT KEY, not the source, and
        ``FromHandForDiscard`` has two unrelated callers. The corpus's other 4
        are cards opening the same screen from their own ``OnPlay``
        (HiddenDaggers, Survivor, DaggerThrow, Prepared); those are
        :meth:`replay_opening_play`'s and are NOT fixed by this path.

        Args:
            world_wire: The world's own board, as the match gate. Comparable
                at either park point, because the probe stops exactly where
                the engine does: at a retain prompt neither side has run the
                enemy turn, at a turn-start discard both have. At the retain
                prompt it is also the REPAIR: a mismatch there is drift the
                turn end cannot have caused, so the fork is reconciled against
                this wire and re-probed (GH #593).

        to be reconstructed -- and then PROVEN, not assumed.

        How much has to be reconstructed depends on what the mod tells us.

        **Told (current builds).** ``source_kind`` says what the source IS by
        runtime type, and for a card ``target_index`` / ``upgraded`` say which
        play it was. Then there is exactly one candidate, the board check
        VERIFIES it, and a mismatch means the mirror is wrong -- which is a
        drop, not a decline.

        **Not told (older builds).** Fall back to proving it from the board:
        replay every legal play of that card on a clone and keep the one whose
        enemy-HP vector matches the world's. That settles which copy and which
        enemy at once, but it is inference: a damage prediction off by any
        amount matches nothing, and the screen goes unanswered
        (``no board matched replay of NEOWS_FURY``, live run
        001-ironclad-a8-0824-2150). Kept only for compatibility.

        A source that is not a card -- a potion (``TouchOfInsanity`` opens a
        ``FromHand`` select with ``source: this``), a power
        (``WELL_LAID_PLANS_POWER``), a relic -- has nothing to replay and is
        left to the unparked recognition in

        Args:
            source_model: The world's name for the effect that opened the
                screen (``CardSelectContextPatch``), when it captured one.
            world_wire: The wire built from the screen's embedded combat --
                the board AFTER the play, used as the match target.
            source_kind: ``"card"`` / ``"potion"`` / ``"power"`` / ... from the
                model's runtime type. ``None`` on an older mod build, which
                falls back to inferring the kind from the piles.
            target_index: The play's target as an index into the full enemy
                list, or ``None`` for an untargeted card.
            upgraded: Whether the copy played was upgraded.
