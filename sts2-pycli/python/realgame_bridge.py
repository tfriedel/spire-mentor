"""TCP client for the real-game "SpireMentor" mod (real-game bridge phase 0).

Speaks the newline-delimited UTF-8 JSON protocol documented in
``sts2-rl-agent/docs/PROTOCOL.md``: the mod (running inside the live Slay the
Spire 2 process) sends a state message carrying a ``request_id`` and blocks
until exactly one action message echoing that ``request_id`` is received.

This module is intentionally stdlib-only (``socket``, ``json``, ``time``,
``logging``) so it has no dependency on the game repo or on
``sts2-rl-agent`` (the donor implementation this was ported from — see
``sts2-rl-agent/sts2_env/bridge/client.py`` — is not imported).

Deviations from the donor client, to match our mod's actual protocol:
  - State messages use ``"type"`` (e.g. ``"combat_action"``), not
    ``"phase"``/``"game_state"``.
  - ``receive_state()`` returns *every* message verbatim (including
    ``"pong"``, ``"game_over"``, ``"run_complete"``, ``"error"``) rather than
    silently swallowing some types — callers dispatch on ``"type"``
    themselves. Only malformed (non-JSON) lines are skipped, with a warning
    logged.
  - Our mod waits indefinitely for a response (no 30s random-play
    fallback), so this client has no artificial urgency; it still responds
    promptly, but a slow decision does not desync the protocol.
  - Unknown fields on any message (e.g. ``"seed"``, ``"floor"``, ``"act"``,
    ``"mod_version"``) are ignored gracefully everywhere — this client never
    validates a message's field set, it only reads the fields it needs.

v2 (phase 1b) protocol additions handled here:
  - ``error`` notifications (``{"type":"error","error":...,"detail":...}``)
    are fire-and-forget, like ``game_over``/``run_complete`` — no
    ``request_id`` is expected or consumed. They flow through
    :meth:`receive_state` like any other message; the client additionally
    remembers the most recent one on :attr:`RealGameBridgeClient.last_error`
    as a convenience flag (reset to ``None`` as soon as a non-error message
    arrives). Per PROTOCOL.md section 3a, an ``error`` is always immediately
    followed by a fresh re-send of the decision it rejected — callers just
    keep looping on :meth:`receive_state` and will see that decision next.
  - :meth:`send_action` now also auto-echoes ``state_id`` (the stale-state
    guard, section 4) from the most recently received message, mirroring the
    existing ``request_id`` auto-echo. Opt out per-call with
    ``echo_state_id=False``.
  - :meth:`start_run` is a convenience wrapper for the ``run_config`` ->
    ``start_run`` handshake (section 3/4), only relevant when the mod's
    ``client_run_config`` flag is enabled.
