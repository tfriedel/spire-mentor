"""Bridge ``combat_action`` (v2) -> Sts2Headless ``combat_play`` decision JSON.

Real-game bridge phase 2: the live game (via the SpireMentor mod) speaks the
wire protocol documented in ``spire-mentor-mod/PROTOCOL.md``; the MCTS
recommender (:mod:`sts2_hint.recommender`) only understands the
Sts2Headless ``combat_play`` decision shape consumed by
:func:`sts2_hint.adapter.translate` (which in turn feeds
``sts2_rs.state_from_dict``). This module bridges the two *without*
touching either -- :func:`to_headless_combat_play` produces a dict in
exactly the shape :mod:`sts2_hint.adapter` already knows how to read
(the same shape ``tests/fixtures/hint_adapter/_helpers.py`` hand-crafts
and Sts2Headless's own ``RunSimulator.cs`` emits for a ``combat_play``
decision), so the existing sts2_hint pipeline is reused completely
unmodified.

Field-mapping notes (verified against ``PROTOCOL.md``, the
``sts2_hint.adapter``/``schema`` source, and the ``sts2-rs`` engine's own
draw-pile semantics -- see the real-game-bridge plan's phase-2 task list):

* **Card ids.** The bridge already sends game-native registry ids in bare
  SCREAMING_SNAKE form (e.g. ``"STRIKE_IRONCLAD"``, ``"BASH"``) with no
  ``/`` or ``CARD.`` prefix -- confirmed these match
  ``sts2_rs.list_registry_names("card")`` directly, so
  :mod:`sts2_hint.adapter`'s bare-id resolution path (``_resolve_card_id``)
  accepts them verbatim. No re-mapping needed.
* **Relic / monster ids.** The bridge sends canonical relic ids
  (``"BURNING_BLOOD"``) that also match the ``sts2_rs`` registry directly,
  but :mod:`sts2_hint.adapter`'s relic translator only accepts a display
  **title** (looked up via ``RELIC_TITLE_TO_ID``) -- so relics are emitted
  keyed by the bridge's ``name`` field, not ``id``. Monsters are the same
  story: the bridge's ``id`` (``"SHRINKER_BEETLE"``) does NOT match the
  registry's CamelCase monster ids (``"ShrinkerBeetle"``), but the bridge's
  ``name`` (``"Shrinker Beetle"``) matches ``MONSTER_TITLE_TO_ID`` exactly,
  so enemies are also emitted keyed by ``name``.
* **Powers.** The bridge's power ``id`` is the C# ``Id.Entry``, which
  keeps a ``_POWER`` suffix the Rust registry strips for most powers
  (``VULNERABLE_POWER`` vs the engine's ``VULNERABLE``) -- exactly the
  case ``sts2_hint.adapter._translate_power`` already falls back from id
  to a title lookup for. Both ``id`` and ``name`` are forwarded verbatim
  and the existing fallback handles the rest.
* **Draw-pile order.** The bridge documents "index 0 is the next card
  drawn" (verified against the v0.107.1 decomp); the ``sts2-rs`` engine
  itself pops from the front of ``state.player.draw`` (``draw.remove(0)``
  in ``combat_loop.rs``) and ``state_dict.rs`` preserves wire order
  1:1 into that vec -- so the bridge's draw/discard/exhaust pile order is
  passed straight through with no reversal.
* **Target/enemy indexing.** ``sts2_hint.display.format_target`` resolves
  an MCTS action's ``target_index`` by matching it against each enemy's
  wire ``index`` field -- i.e. ``target_index`` is the enemy's *position*
  in the ``enemies`` array, exactly the same 0-based addressing the
  bridge's own ``play``/``potion`` ``target_index`` uses. So an MCTS
  recommendation's ``target_index`` can be sent back to the bridge
  unchanged.
* **Hand ``stable_idx``.** Sts2Headless's ``card.index`` on a hand card
  becomes ``CardSpec.stable_idx``, which the recommender maps back via
  ``hand[card_index]["stable_idx"]`` where ``card_index`` is the
  *position* in the translated hand list (0-based) -- i.e. positional in
  our own emitted list, matching the bridge's own ``play`` verb
  addressing (``card_index`` always indexes ``hand[card_index]``). We set
  each hand card's ``index`` to its position so ``stable_idx`` round-trips
  as exactly the bridge ``card_index`` to send back.
* **``unplayable`` keyword.** Only set when the bridge's
  ``unplayable_reason`` mentions ``HasUnplayableKeyword`` -- NOT whenever
  ``playable`` is false. The bridge's ``playable`` flag is dynamic (energy
  availability included); naively mapping "not playable right now" to the
  wire's static ``unplayable`` ``CardFlag`` would permanently lock out a
  card that's merely too expensive at this instant, corrupting every
  future-turn rollout the MCTS simulates.
* **``master_deck``.** Bridge sends the full deck at
  ``run_state.master_deck``, and ``sts2_hint.schema.DeckSpec`` documents an
  optional ``master_deck`` slot. We translate it and attach it as a
  top-level ``"master_deck"`` key (this module's own output shape has no
  nested ``deck`` object -- see the module docstring's overview), which
  ``sts2_hint.adapter.translate()`` reads via ``state.get("master_deck")``
  and threads into ``wire["deck"]["master_deck"]`` for
  ``sts2_rs.state_from_dict``.

Known gaps -- fields the headless ``combat_play`` schema can carry that
the bridge does not (yet) send:

* ``context.room_type`` / elite flag: forwarded from a top-level
  ``room_type`` when the bridge sends one (SimCombatHandler emits
  ``RunState.CurrentRoom.RoomType`` since the 2026-08-02 dialect audit;
  deploy-pending); otherwise defaults to ``"Combat"`` (non-elite).
* ``stars`` (Regent mechanic): forwarded from ``player.stars`` when the
  bridge sends it (same deploy-pending mod build); omitted before that.
* Card ``stats`` / ``enchantment`` / ``enchantment_amount``: forwarded
  when present (same deploy-pending mod build -- see ``_translate_card``);
  absent on older mod builds, which leaves the engine's registry/upgrade
  fallbacks in charge exactly as before.

Formerly-listed gaps, now closed:

* ``play_pile``, power ``display_amount`` and power ``vars`` **are now
  forwarded**. All three were added to the headless (``Sts2Headless``) wire by
  the v11/v12 mirror-fidelity fixes and the bridge was left behind on them, so
  the live arm ran the same mirror against a wire that still withheld the card
  mid-play and the CrimsonMantle/WitheringPresence counters. The bridge emits
  them from ``SimCombatHandler.BuildCombatState`` /
  ``SimStateExtractor.SerializePower``; this module passes them through.
* The layered cost fields (``base_cost`` / ``persistent_cost`` /
  ``played_cost`` / ``stable_cost``) **are now forwarded** (see
  ``_translate_card``). The bridge has emitted them since the v15/v20
  mirror-fidelity catch-ups (``SimStateExtractor.SerializeCard``), but this
  module dropped them, so the live reconstruction ran cost_override-only:
  the engine baked transient discounts in permanently and lost every
  turn-boundary/when-played cost reset -- the dominant pile-desync class of
  the first persistent-mirror live sweep.
* The RNG lineage block (``rng.run_seed`` + ``rng.counters``) **is now
  forwarded** (2026-08-02 dialect audit). ``SimStateExtractor.ApplyEnvelope``
  has published it on every ``combat_action`` (and on the ``card_select``
  embedded board) since the mirror's restore path landed, but this module
  dropped it -- so on the live arm ``sts2_hint.adapter._rng_block`` never saw
  a ``run_seed``, ``CombatMirror.reconcile`` never let the world own the
  dice, and every live shuffle/intent prediction was structurally a guess
  (verified: no ``mirror_live2.jsonl`` world_wire carries ``run_seed``).
  Forwarded ALL-OR-NOTHING, mirroring the producer/consumer contract: a
  partial block (seed without counters) is worse than none.
* ``player.gold`` **is now forwarded** (same audit) from
  ``run_state.gold``. The gold-gated relic hooks (SealOfGold's 5-gold
  turn-start energy buy) rebuilt against the engine default of no gold on
  the live arm only -- the exact class the v27wr sweep pinned on the DLL arm
  (90 of 178 ``$.player.energy`` divergences) fixed there but not here.
* ``EnemySpec.move_state`` **is now forwarded** (see ``_translate_enemy``).
  The bridge's telegraphed ``next_move_id`` is the monster's current
  ``MonsterState`` id, and those id strings match sts2-rs's enemy-AI state
  names 1:1, so ``sts2_rs.state_from_dict`` reconstructs the real move-state
  machine (``force_current_state_by_name``) and rollouts replay the true
  moveset -- fixing the prior overconfidence on scaling bosses (e.g. the Kin
  Priest, whose ``RITUAL_MOVE`` stacks Strength every cycle) where the
  heuristic-AI fallback made MCTS score a losing fight as a near-certain win.

    counter relic (Nunchaku, Kusarigama, HappyFlower, Pen Nib, ...)
    reconstructed with ``counter=None`` on the live path only, and melted wax
    relics stayed hook-active in the mirror.

    The canonical ``id`` (``RelicModel.Id.Entry``) is forwarded alongside the
    ``name`` because the live ``name`` is neither stable nor complete:

    * ``SimStateExtractor.SerializeRelic`` sends ``relic.Title.GetFormattedText()``,
      and ``RelicModel.Title`` PREFIXES a wax relic with ToyBox's
      ``"Wax {Title}"`` template (RelicModel.cs:48-61, ToyBox.cs:26,
      ``localization_eng/relics.json`` ``"TOY_BOX.waxRelicPrefix"``). Every wax
      title therefore misses ``RELIC_TITLE_TO_ID`` -- and ToyBox grants FOUR
      wax relics at once (ToyBox.cs:87-95), so all four vanished from every
      reconstructed live combat state.
    * Relics that exist in the live build but not in this repo's
      ``localization_eng/`` snapshot (FISHING_ROD, SILKEN_TRESS) have no title
      key at all and soft-dropped the same way.

    ``sts2_hint.adapter._translate_relic`` prefers a registry-valid ``id`` and
    keeps the title path as the fallback, mirroring what the headless wire
    already does (RunSimulator.cs:5047 emits both ``id`` and ``name``).

#: Epochs the LIVE save appears not to have revealed yet (GH #367).
#:
#: **FALLBACK ONLY as of GH #374.** SpireMentor now puts the save's real
#: ``UnlockState.ToSerializable().UnlockedEpochs`` on the envelope, and
#: :func:`install_unlock_state_from_wire` supersedes this constant on the first
#: message that carries it — logging a warning when the two disagree, which is
#: the signal that this census has gone stale. This list still covers the gap
#: before the first message arrives, and any mod build predating the field.
#:
#: The engine had no access to the save's ``UnlockState``, so this was inferred
#: from the world wires themselves: ``python -m diag_epoch_census`` counts how
#: often each epoch-gated card is named anywhere in a corpus, and an epoch is
#: all-or-nothing, so a clean 0-of-3 against siblings that appear freely is the
#: signature of an unrevealed epoch.
#:
#: Provenance — the 2026-08-03 A1 corpora (1082 records; Defect 545 / Regent
#: 223 / Necrobinder 186 / Silent 128):
#:
#: * ``REGENT5``  — 0/3, vs Regent2 at 276/84/225 and Regent7 at 155/44/3.
#:   Strongest of the set, and the one with an independent confirmation: it
#:   holds exactly one Attack, which is the +1 ``combat_card_generation`` drift
#:   measured on 37/37 CROSSBOW end-turn records.
#: * ``NECROBINDER5`` / ``NECROBINDER7`` — 0/3 each, vs Necrobinder2 at
#:   330/99/21.
#: * ``SILENT5`` / ``SILENT7`` — 0/3 each, vs Silent2 at 110/3/42. WEAKEST of
#:   the set: only 128 Silent records back it.
#:
#: Defect is the control: all three of its epochs are sighted, so the census
#: can distinguish revealed from unrevealed rather than just reporting silence.
#: No colorless epoch is locked — each has at least one sighting.
#:
#: Absence is weaker evidence than presence, so this is a measurable hypothesis
#: rather than a known fact: if it is wrong for a character, the next live sweep
#: shows a NEW cursor drift for that character instead of the old one.
