"""The advisor's "hand back" verdict for decisions it cannot actually make (GH #874).

F7 used to play every such screen anyway -- the first option of an unranked
surface, a borrowed head's ranking -- and the player had no way to tell it was
happening. The advisor now says so on ``advice.hand_back``, and the mod's
``pause_on: "unsupported"`` stops autoplay there. The verdict lives here rather
than in a mod-side list so that a surface gaining a trained head stops pausing
on its own; these tests pin which answers carry it and which must not.
